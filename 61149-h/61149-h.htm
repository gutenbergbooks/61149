  <h2 class='c007'>The Left Hind Foot</h2>
</div>
<h3 class='c010'>I<br /> <br />ANGELS</h3>
<p class='c011'>He was the most innocent-looking chap you
ever saw. He had the face of a cherub, eyes which
inhabit the faces of angels, and a smile which every
woman envied.</p>

<p class='c005'>During her lifetime his mother had called him an
angel. His sister composed a title for him from
the initials of his name, and for short called him
Org. The neighbors called him—if everything
the neighbors called him should be recorded, this
story would have to be fumigated at the very start.</p>

<p class='c005'>He had just come to Tickfall from California.
His mother and father did not miss him when he
left, for they were dead. The neighbors missed
him, but they did not mourn his loss. When Orren
Randolph Gaitskill had gone, some predicted that
he would be the loudest tick in Tickfall. They
did not mean to flatter the youth or pay him a
compliment. Everybody breathed easier, the
cats came down out of the trees, the little girls
<a id='Page_2'></a>walked the streets without the fear that their pig-tails
of hair would be used for leading ropes, and
the old inhabitants thankfully prophesied that
there would be no more earthquakes in California.</p>

<p class='c005'>As for Miss Virginia Harwick Gaitskill, his
sister—bless her! the earth never shook when
she was around, but the hearts of men were
strangely agitated.</p>

<p class='c005'>Everybody called Miss Virginia an angel except
her angelic brother. He called her “Gince.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Just now that young lady stood upon the portico
of Colonel Tom Gaitskill’s home, calling in a clear,
deep-toned voice:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Org! Oh, Org! Come here!”</p>

<p class='c005'>That youth, who had been playing “Indian”
upon the Gaitskill lawn, promptly dropped upon
his stomach at the sound of her voice, kept himself
concealed behind some thick shrubbery, and
began, as he expressed it, to “do a sneak.” His
intended destination was the capacious stable in
the rear of the premises. But he did not get far.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Hurry up, Org! Come on here! I see you!”
his sister called.</p>

<p class='c005'>Her last remark was an absolute falsehood. She
did not see him. But angels have a language of
their own. It is not possible to command their
attendance by ordinary earthly methods, and
Virginia’s way succeeded.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Aw, what you want, Gince? A feller can’t
have no time to himself when you are around.”</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_3'></a>“I want stamps, Org,” the girl said sweetly.
“Take this fifty-cent piece and bring me back
twenty-five twos.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What’s the name of that there woman in that
post-office?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Miss Paunee,” she told him.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It sounds like a mustang name to me,” Org
remarked, pocketing the money ungraciously, and
starting away with his hat pulled down over his
eyes.</p>

<p class='c005'>A moment later he assumed his former character,
that of a prowling Indian, and his progress
toward the street was from bush to bush and
from tree to tree. He crept noiselessly down the
street, looking from side to side with alert watchfulness,
giving each bit of shrubbery and clump of
weeds a careful inspection in anticipation of lurking
enemies. When he came to the brow of the
hill he ran downward at full speed. It was easier
to run than to walk; slower speed would require
the effort of holding back, and a genuine Indian
hates work. At the foot of the hill he stopped like
a clock with a broken spring.</p>

<p class='c005'>There stood before him a little negro boy, almost
exactly his size, and apparently his own age.
Org’s first impression was that the stranger was
certainly dark-complected, there being no variation
in the color scheme except the whites of his
eyes. Org’s next thought was that the darky was
queerly dressed.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_4'></a>He was wearing a woman’s silk shirt-waist; his
coat had originally belonged to some woman’s
coat-suit, adjusted to the present wearer by bobbing
its tail. His trousers had once belonged to some
man who was much larger in the waist and much
longer in the leg; but the present owner of the
nether garments had made certain clumsy adjustments
and the trousers made a sort of fit. The
stranger’s legs were covered with a woman’s
purple-silk stockings, and on his flat feet were a
pair of high-heeled pumps.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Hello!” Org said, his eyes glued to the ladylike
clothes.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Mawnin’, Marse, howdy?” the little negro
responded timidly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“My name ain’t Marse, it’s Org,” the white boy
replied. “What’s your name? Who are you?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dey calls me Little Bit. I’s Cap’n Kerley’s
white nigger, an’ I sorter janitors aroun’ de Hen-Scratch.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“White nigger?” Org remarked wonderingly,
after a comprehensive survey of the negro boy.
“The white of your eyes is white. That’s all the
white I can see. Where you going?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Out to de Cooley bayou on de Nigger-Heel
plantation.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Me, too,” Org remarked as he fell in step
beside the negro boy.</p>

<p class='c005'>Which is the reason why Miss Gaitskill waited
impatiently the rest of the day for her stamps.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_5'></a>Without knowing it, Orren Randolph Gaitskill
had found the greatest playmate in the world. Let
every man born south of the Ohio River say
“Amen!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Little Bit was an angel, too. His mother called
him “her angel chile.” His mother had fifteen
other angelic children in her cabin, Little Bit being
the youngest and the last. So his mother named
him Peter, after his father, and Postscript to indicate
his location in the annals of the family; thus
Peter Postscript Chew took his place in the world.</p>

<p class='c005'>But white folks never pay any attention to a
negro’s name. They called him Little Bit.</p>

<p class='c005'>In front of the Hen-Scratch saloon in the negro
settlement known as Dirty-Six, Little Bit climbed
into an empty farm-wagon to which two mules
were harnessed.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dis here is Mustard Prophet’s team. He’s de
overseer on Marse Tom’s Nigger-Heel plantation.
I prefers to set down an’ travel. It ails my foots
to walk. Mustard’ll let us ride.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I rode in a automobile in California,” Org remarked
as he climbed into the wagon beside Little
Bit.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You’s fixin’ to ride in a aughter-be-a-mule
now,” Little Bit snickered.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mustard came out of the saloon and viewed the
two boys with a great pretense of surprise.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You two young gen’lemans gwine out wid me,
too?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_6'></a>“Yes, suh,” Little Bit told him.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Gosh! I’ll shore hab a busy day wid de babies,”
Mustard growled in a good-natured tone. “Dat
ole Popsy Spout is in de secont imbecility of his
secont childhood, an’ dis here white chile an’ dis
cullud chile—lawdy!”</p>

<p class='c005'>He climbed upon the wagon seat and clucked
to his mules, driving slowly down the crooked,
sandy road toward the Shin Bone eating-house.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You boys watch dis team till I gits back,” he
ordered. “Popsy’s gwine out wid us.”</p>
<h3 class='c010'>II<br /> <br />POPSY SPOUT</h3>

<p class='c011'>About the time the boys had climbed into Mustard’s
wagon in front of the saloon, Popsy Spout
had entered the door of the eating-house and stood
there with all the hesitancy of imbecility.</p>

<p class='c005'>He was over six feet tall and as straight as an
Indian. His face was as black as tar, and was
seamed with a thousand tiny wrinkles. His long
hair was as white as milk, and his two wrinkled
and withered hands rested like an eagle’s talons
upon a patriarchal staff nearly as tall as himself.</p>

<p class='c005'>On his head was a stove-pipe hat, bell-shaped,
the nap long since worn off and the top of the hat
stained a brick-red by exposure to the weather.
An old, faded, threadbare and patched sack coat
<a id='Page_7'></a>swathed his emaciated form like a bobtailed bath-robe.</p>

<p class='c005'>The greatest blight which old age had left upon
his dignified form was in his eyes: the vacant, age-dimmed
stare of second childhood, denoting that
reason no longer sat regnant upon the crystal
throne of the intellect.</p>

<p class='c005'>There were many tables in the eating-house, but
Popsy could not command his mind and his judgment
to the point of deciding which table he would
choose or in which chair he would seat himself.</p>

<p class='c005'>Shin Bone, from the rear of his restaurant,
looked up and gave a grunt of disgust.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dar’s dat ole fool come back agin,” he growled.
“Ef you’d set him in one of dese here revolver
chairs, he wouldn’t hab sense enough to turn
around in it. I reckon I’ll hab to go an’ sell him
a plate of soup.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Mawnin’, Popsy,” he said cordially, as he
walked to the door where the old man stood. Shin
reserved a private opinion of all his patrons, but
outwardly he was very courteous to all of them,
for very good business reasons.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Mawnin’, Shinny,” Popsy said with a sighing
respiration. “I wus jes’ tryin’ to reckoleck whut
I come in dis place fur an’ whar must I set down
at.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I reckin you better set down up close to de
kitchen, whar you kin smell de vittles. Dat’ll
git you more fer yo’ money,” Shin snickered. “I
<a id='Page_8'></a>reckin you is hankerin’ atter a bowl of soup, ain’t
you?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I b’lieve dat wuz whut I come in dis place fer.
I’s gittin’ powerful fergitful as de days goes by.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You comes in here mighty nigh eve’y day fer a
bowl of soup,” Shin told him. “Is you fergot dat
fack?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Is dat possible?” Popsy exclaimed. “I muss
be spendin’ my money too free.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You needn’t let dat worry yo’ mind,” Shin replied,
as he motioned to a negro waitress to bring
the soup. “You ain’t got nobody to suppote but
yo’ own self.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Figger Bush lives wid me,” Popsy growled.
“He oughter he’p suppote me some, but he won’t
do it. He wuz always a most onreliable pickaninny,
an’ all de good I ever got out of him I had
to beat out wid a stick.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Figger’s wife oughter git some wuck out of him,”
Shin laughed.</p>

<p class='c005'>“She cain’t do it! Excusin’ dat, she ain’t home
right now. Dat’s how come I’s got to eat wid
you,” Popsy grumbled, digging the tine of his fork
into the soft pine table to accentuate his remarks,
and then flourishing the fork in the air for emphasis.
“Figger is de lazies’ nigger in de worl’.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Having uttered this remark, the old man leaned
back in his chair and thrust the fork into his coat
pocket while his aged eyes stared out of the window
at nothing. Shin noted the disappearance of the
<a id='Page_9'></a>fork, but did not mention it. The negro waitress
appeared, placed the soup under the old man’s
nose and went away. At last he glanced down.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Fer de Lawd’s sake!” he exclaimed. “Whar did
dis here soup come from?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You jes’ now ordered it,” Shin said sharply.
“I had a cullud gal fotch it to you, an’ you got to
pay fer it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I won’t pay for it ontil atter I done et it,”
Popsy growled.</p>

<p class='c005'>He picked up a knife, started to dip it into the
soup, found that this was the wrong tool, and
thrust the knife into the pocket of his coat to keep
company with the purloined fork.</p>

<p class='c005'>Shin noted the disappearance of the knife, but
said nothing. He handed Popsy a pewter spoon
and remarked:</p>

<p class='c005'>“You better lap it up quick, Popsy; she’ll be
gittin’ cold in a minute.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Who’ll be gittin’ cold?” Popsy asked absently.
“I didn’t hear tell of no she havin’ a cold. Is she
got a rigger? Dese here spring days draws out all
de p’ison in de blood.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Naw, suh. I says de soup will git cold.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Aw,” Popsy answered, as he dipped his spoon
in the liquid and sipped it. “Dis soup am pretty
tol’able good. Does you chaw yo’ vittles fawty
times, Shinny?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not de same vittles,” Shin said. “I chaws
mo’ dan fawty times at a meal, I reckin.”</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_10'></a>“Marse Tom Gaitskill says dat people oughter
chaw deir vittles fawty times befo’ dey swallows
it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’d hate to practise on a oystyer,” Shin giggled.
“White folks is always talkin’ fool notions.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Shin sat by and watched the old man as he consumed
the remainder of his soup in silence. He
also ate some crackers, drank a cup of coffee, to all
appearances unconscious that Shin sat beside him.
Finally, he looked up with a slightly surprised
manner and asked:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Whut did you say to me, Shinny?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I said I’d hate to practise on oystyers.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Practise whut on oystyers?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Chawin’ one fawty times,” Shin explained.</p>

<p class='c005'>“My gawsh!” Popsy snorted. “Who ever
heard tell of anybody in his real good sense chawin’
a raw oystyer fawty times? Is you gone crippled
in yo’ head?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Naw, suh, I——”</p>

<p class='c005'>The old man did not wait for the reply, but interrupted
by rising to his feet with the intention
of going out. The spoon he was holding he did
not lay down upon the table, but carried it toward
the door with him.</p>

<p class='c005'>“De price is fifteen cents, Popsy,” Shin reminded
him, as he followed him toward the front.
“Let me hold yo’ spoon while you feels fer yo’
money.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I didn’t fotch no spoon wid me,” the old man
<a id='Page_11'></a>whined, as he held it out to Shin. “Dis spoon is
your’n.”</p>

<p class='c005'>He paid the money to Shin, and started toward
the door again, when he was once more intercepted.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Lemme fix de collar of yo’ coat, brudder,”
Shin suggested.</p>

<p class='c005'>He seized the old man by the shoulders, shook
the loose coat on his thin shoulders, and pretended
to fit it around his wrinkled neck; at the same
time, he thrust his hand into the coat pocket and
extracted the purloined knife and fork.</p>

<p class='c005'>Popsy never missed them. In fact, he did not
know that he had them. Shin handed him his
patriarchal staff and gave him a slight push toward
the door.</p>

<p class='c005'>At that moment Mustard Prophet stood at the
entrance, “Is you ready to go out, Popsy?”
Mustard asked cordially, as he shook hands.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dar now!” Popsy snorted. “I knowed I
come in dis place fer some puppus, but I couldn’t
think whut it wus. I promised to meet Mustard
here. He’s gwine take me out to his house to
dinner, an’ I’m done went an’ et!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dat’s no diffunce, Popsy,” Mustard chuckled.
“You’ll be hongry agin by de time you gits out
to de Nigger-Heel.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Popsy stopped beside the wagon and stared in
pop-eyed amazement at the white boy who sat
with his feet hanging out of the rear end.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Befo’ Gawd!” the old man bawled. “Dar’s
<a id='Page_12'></a>little Jimmy Gaitskill dat I ain’t seed fer sixty
year’!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You’s gwine back too fur, Popsy,” Mustard
laughed. “Dat’s Marse Jimmy Gaitskill’s grandchile.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Huh,” the old man grunted, as Mustard helped
him to a seat in the wagon. “De Gaitskills look
de same all over de worl’.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“How does dey look, Popsy?” Mustard chuckled.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dey’s got de look of eagles,” Popsy replied.</p>

<p class='c005'>Shin watched the wagon until it disappeared
around a turn in the road. His eyes were on
Popsy’s bent form as far as he could see it.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dat’s de biggest bat I ever knowed,” Shin
remarked to the world as he turned back and
entered his place of business.</p>
<h3 class='c010'>III<br /> <br />THE RABBIT-FOOT</h3>

<p class='c011'>Two hours later, Mustard Prophet stopped his
wagon in the horse-lot of the Nigger-Heel plantation.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dis is whar you mounts down, Popsy,” he said.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Whut does I git off here fer?” Popsy asked
querulously.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Gawd knows,” Mustard grinned. “I done
fotch you out to de plantation as by per yo’ own
request. Dis is it.”</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_13'></a>He lifted the aged man down and walked with
him to the house, making slow progress as the old
man supported himself with his staff and insisted
on stopping at frequent intervals to discuss some
vagary of his mind, or to dispute something that
Mustard had said.</p>

<p class='c005'>At last Mustard assisted him to a chair on the
porch and handed him a glass of water.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Glad to hab you-alls out here wid me, Popsy,”
he proclaimed. “Set down an’ rest yo’ hat and
foots.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I ain’t seed de Nigger-Heel plantation fer
nigh onto fifty year,” Popsy whined. “I used to
wuck on dis plantation off an’ on when I wus a
growin’ saplin’.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dis place is changed some plenty since you
used to potter aroun’ it,” Mustard said pridefully.
“Marse Tom specify dat dis am one of de show-farms
of all Louzanny. I made it jes’ whut it is
now.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dis ole house is ’bout all I reckernizes real
good,” Popsy replied. “It ain’t changed much.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Naw, suh. I don’t let dis house git changed.
Marse Tom lived here a long time, an’ when he
moved to town I’s kinder kep’ de house like it wus
when he lef’ it, only sorter made it like his’n in
Tickfall. Marse Tom is gwine lemme live here
till I dies. He tole me dat hisse’f.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It shore is nice to hab a good home,” Popsy
said, looking vacantly toward the near-by woods,
<a id='Page_14'></a>where he could hear the loud shouts of Little Bit
and Orren Randolph Gaitskill.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Would you wish to see de insides of de house?”
Mustard asked. “I got eve’ything plain an’
simple, but it’s fine an’ dandy fer a nigger whose
wife ain’t never out here to keep house. Hopey
cooks fer Marse Tom, an’ I got to take keer of
things by myse’f.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It’s real nice not to hab no lady folks snoopin’
aroun’ de place,” Popsy asserted. “Dey blim-blams
you all de time about spittin’ on de flo’ an’
habin’ muddy foots.”</p>

<p class='c005'>They walked about the house inspecting it.
Popsy followed Mustard about, listening inattentively
to Mustard’s talk, wondering what it was
all about. He came to one room which attracted
his attention because it looked as though it held
the accumulated junk of years.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Whut you keep all dis trash in dis room fer,
Mustard?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dis ain’t trash. Dese here is Marse Tom’s
curiosities,” Mustard explained. “Dis is like a
show—all kinds of funny things in here.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The old man stepped within the room, and Mustard
began to act as showman, displaying and expatiating
upon all the interesting things of the place.</p>

<p class='c005'>The room bore a remote resemblance to a
museum. When Gaitskill had first moved on the
plantation, nearly fifty years before, he had
amused himself by making a collection of the
<a id='Page_15'></a>things he found upon the farm and in the woods,
which interested him or took his fancy. For instance,
here was a vine which was twisted so that
it resembled a snake. That was all there was to
it. Because it looked like a snake, Gaitskill had
picked it up and brought it to the house and added
it to his collection.</p>

<p class='c005'>Stuff of this sort had accumulated in that room
for years. Mustard had no use for the room.
Gaitskill had not needed it before him. When
the overseer moved in, he had zealously guarded
Marse Tom’s curiosities. As for Colonel Gaitskill,
he did not even know the trash was in existence.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mustard had added to the accumulation through
the years. Now and then, in his work in the fields
or woods, he would find something that reminded
him of something that Marse Tom had “saved”
in that room, so he would bring it in and add that
to the pile.</p>

<p class='c005'>So now Mustard had something to talk to Popsy
about, and he talked Popsy to the verge of distraction,
proclaiming all sorts of fanciful reasons
for the preservation of each curious object. The
old man was bored as he had never been bored in
all his life. His feeble form began to droop with
weariness, his mind failed to grasp the words which
Mustard pronounced with such unction, but Mustard
did not notice, and would not have minded if
he had observed Popsy’s inattention. He intoned
his words impressively and talked on and on.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_16'></a>At last Mustard opened a drawer and drew out
a small, green-plush box. He opened this box with
impressive gestures, as if it was some sacred object
to be handled with extreme reverence. He
held the opened box under Popsy Spout’s nose.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dat’s de greatest treasure we’s got in dis house,
Popsy,” he announced.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Whut am dat?” Popsy asked, rallying his
scattered wits.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dat’s de royal rabbit-foot whut fotch all de
luck to de Nigger-Heel plantation,” Mustard proclaimed.
“Marse Tom gimme dat foot fifteen
years ago. He said dat all his luck come from dat
foot. He tole me to keep it an’ it would fotch
good luck to me. It shore has done it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Popsy gazed down into the plush box. What he
saw was a rabbit-foot with a silver cap on one end,
and in the center of the cap was a small ring which
might be used to hang the rabbit-foot on a watch-chain
if one cared to possess such a watch-charm.</p>

<p class='c005'>A few years ago the rabbit-foot novelty was for
sale in any jewelry store in the South, and cost
about one dollar. Because of the negro superstition
regarding the luck of the rabbit’s foot, Gaitskill
had bought one for his negro overseer.</p>

<p class='c005'>The white man in the South in his dealings with
the negroes is never skeptical of their favorite
superstitions. In presenting the rabbit-foot to
Mustard, Gaitskill had drawn upon his imagination
and told a wonderful story of the efficacy of
<a id='Page_17'></a>this particular luck-charm. He had been lost in
the swamp, so Gaitskill said, and this foot had
shown him the way out; he had fallen into the
Gulf of Mexico, and this foot had saved his life;
he had been poor, and now he was rich; he had
been sick, and now he was well; he had been
young, and now he was old—and all because of
the luck of that particular rabbit-foot. All of this
emphasized in Mustard’s mind the importance
which Gaitskill attached to the possession of the
foot, and made him believe that the white man
only parted with it because he wanted his favorite
negro overseer to share some of the good fortune
which had come to him.</p>

<p class='c005'>The tale had so impressed Mustard that he regarded
that plush box with its sacred foot as being
the most valuable thing upon the Nigger-Heel
plantation. He guarded it constantly, and would
have protected it from theft or injury with his life.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dat is puffeckly wonderful,” Mustard declared,
gazing at the treasure with reverent eyes.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, suh, dat’s whut,” Popsy agreed dreamily
“Le’s hunt some place to set down.”</p>
<h3 class='c010'>IV<br /> <br />BLACK IS BLACK</h3>

<p class='c011'>In the meantime, Orren Randolph Gaitskill
was out in the woods, getting acquainted with
<a id='Page_18'></a>Little Bit. He asked many questions, and in a
brief time he thought he knew all about his companion.
Then he made a discovery, so unexpected,
so overwhelming, that it terrified him and
sent him through the woods and up to the house,
squalling like a monkey.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dar’s a dandy swimmin’-hole over by dat
cypress-tree, Marse Org,” Little Bit remarked.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I ain’t been swimming since I left the Pacific
Ocean,” was Org’s reply as he started in a run
toward the designated spot.</p>

<p class='c005'>As he ran, he began to shed his clothes. His
hat dropped off first because that was easiest to
remove, then his tie, after that his shirt was jerked
off and cast aside. He could have been trailed
from the starting point to the bayou by the clothes
he left behind him. On the edge of the water he
hopped out of his remaining garments and plunged
head-first into the stream.</p>

<p class='c005'>Ten seconds later, he rose to the surface shaking
the water out of his eyes. It had taken Little Bit
just that much longer to undress. At that moment,
Little Bit leaped into the water, arms and
legs outspread, his purpose being to make as much
splash as possible.</p>

<p class='c005'>He made a big splash, but he made a bigger
sensation.</p>

<p class='c005'>When Org saw that black object coming into
the water after him, he got out of there. With a
terrified shriek he splashed to the bank, scrambled
<a id='Page_19'></a>up the muddy, slippery edge, and ran squalling
across the woods toward the plantation-house.</p>

<p class='c005'>Little Bit was mystified and terrified. He
followed the shrieking white boy through the
woods. Org ran into the open field, uttering a
terrified wail at each jump. His fright became
contagious, and while Little Bit did not have the
least idea what it was all about, he added his wails
to Org’s lamentations, and the woods echoed with
the sounds of woe.</p>

<p class='c005'>They scrambled over the fence and into the
yard and ran screaming up the steps and into the
house, just as Popsy had suggested that they hunt
a place to sit down.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mustard ran into the hall and confronted two
boys, naked as the day they were born, both
screaming at the top of their voices.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Shut up, you idjit chillun!” Mustard howled.
“Whut de debbil ails you? Whar is yo’-all’s
clothes at?”</p>

<p class='c005'>The terrified white boy ran to Mustard, threw
both arms around his waist, and buried his face in
Mustard’s coat-tail to shut out the awful sight.
But he did not stop his screaming.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Hey, you brats!” Mustard whooped. “Shut
up yo’ heads! Whut you howlin’ about? Hush!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Both boys suddenly stopped screaming, and
there was a moment of silence. Mustard waited
for them to get their breath and explain. All
sorts of things had happened in Mustard’s variegated
<a id='Page_20'></a>career, but this was new, to have two boys
come prancing into his house without a stitch of
clothes on their bodies, both screaming like maniacs.
Little Bit was the first to catch his breath
and speak.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Whut ails you, Marse Org?” he asked in that
soft, drawling, pathetic tone, whose minor note is
the heritage of generations of servile ancestors.
“Is a snake done bit you? Is you done fall
straddle of a allergater when you jumped in de
water? How come you ack dis-a-way?”</p>

<p class='c005'>These questions served as a sufficient explanation
to Mustard for their lack of clothes. Something
had frightened them while they were swimming
in the bayou.</p>

<p class='c005'>Org opened his eyes and peeped around Mustard’s
hip at Little Bit. Then he stepped aside and
took a long look at the colored boy’s ebony body.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why, Little Bit,” Org exclaimed, “you are
black all over your body!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Suttinly,” Little Bit agreed heartily. “I’s
black as de bottom of a deep hole in de night-time.
I’s a real <i>cullud</i> pusson, I is.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But—but—I thought you would be white
under your clothes,” Org exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Naw, suh, I ain’t never been no color but
black, inside an’ out, on top an’ down under,”
Little Bit chuckled.</p>

<p class='c005'>“But you said you were the cap’ns white nigger,”
Org argued.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_21'></a>“Dat don’t mean white in color,” Little Bit
explained. “De cap’n, he jes’ calls me dat because
I remembers my raisin’ an’ does my manners
an’ acks white.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It ’pears to me like you boys is bofe fergot yo’
raisin’ an’ yo’ manners,” Mustard snorted. “Whut
you mean by comin’ up to my house as naked as
a new-hatched jay-bird? ’Spose dey wus lady folks
in dis house—whut dey ain’t, bless Gawd!
Wouldn’t you two pickaninnies cut a caper runnin’
aroun’ here wid nothin’ on but yo’selfs an’ yo’ own
skins?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I was so scared I left my clothes on the creek,”
Org explained shamefacedly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ll go back wid you-alls. I don’t b’lieve you
bofe got sense enough to find yo’ gyarments,”
Mustard grumbled. “Whar wus you-all swimmin’
at?”</p>

<p class='c005'>As the three walked out, Popsy Spout stood for
a moment, his vacant eyes wandering over a room
full of the most astounding accumulation of junk
any collector ever assembled. It all meant nothing
to Popsy. He was tired, awfully tired. The
ride from town had wearied him, Mustard’s talk
had wearied him, the pickaninnies on the plantation
seemed to make a lot of noise. A long time
ago he had asked Mustard to find him some place
to sit down. He decided he would prefer to lie
down. He needed rest and calm.</p>

<p class='c005'>But Mustard was gone somewhere. He could
<a id='Page_22'></a>hear his bawling voice getting farther away from
the house all the time. He might be gone for a
long time. He couldn’t sit down on that pile of
junk. So Popsy walked feebly to the door and
stood looking into the hall.</p>

<p class='c005'>As he put his hand up to the door-jamb to support
himself, he discovered that he was holding
something. It was a green-plush box. He wondered
what the box was. It was probably something,
he could not remember what.</p>

<p class='c005'>He put the box in the pocket of his coat, found
a rocking chair, sat down and went to sleep.</p>
<h3 class='c010'>V<br /> <br />THE PLUSH BOX</h3>

<p class='c011'>Org walked back to the bayou under the escort
of Mustard Prophet. He seemed unable to take
his eyes off of Little Bit’s shiny black skin. He
was slow to overcome his amazement at his discovery
that a negro was black all over.</p>

<p class='c005'>When they were riding home in big Mustard’s
farm-wagon, he referred to it again.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You’re a negro, ain’t you, Little Bit?” he
asked, speaking in a softly apologetic tone, as if
fearing to cause offense.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Suttin!” Little Bit laughed. “I’s a black
Affikin nigger. Anybody dat looks how dark complected
I is kin see dat.”</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_23'></a>“I never saw many colored persons in my life,”
Org explained.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You ain’t had no eyes ef you ain’t seed no
niggers,” Little Bit chuckled. “Niggers is eve’ywhar.
Gawd made ’em in de night, made ’em in
a hurry an’ fergot to make ’em white. Dar’s
niggers in heaven, an’ dars even plenty niggers
in hell.”</p>

<p class='c005'>At the Shin Bone eating-house, Mustard helped
Popsy Spout down from the wagon and the two
boys jumped to the ground. Popsy entered the
restaurant, walked feebly over to a table and
seated himself with a thankful sigh. He took out
his pipe and placed it upon the table at his elbow,
then spread a red bandana handkerchief over his
head to keep the flies from disturbing him. Then
he sank into a restful state of dreamy inanity, his
mind just as near empty as it is possible for anything
to be, considering the fact that nature abhors
a vacuum.</p>

<p class='c005'>In one corner of the room, the proprietor, Shin
Bone, was engaged in some interesting experiments
with loaded dice. He seemed never weary
of his task as he rolled the cubes across the table,
retrieved them again, and repeated. He tried
to familiarize himself with their vagaries, to study
their oddities and eccentricities, and in his imagination
he planned many victories and great
winnings through the aid of these pet bones.</p>

<p class='c005'>The process was absorbing to him. His eyes
<a id='Page_24'></a>popped out, the whites showing in a wide ring.
His breathing was quick and husky as he shook
the dice, and he muttered prayers and imprecations
and incantations. Sometimes he threw the
dice with one hand, sometimes with the other; he
used certain luck charms, changing them from one
pocket to the other, practising and experimenting
with every sort of “conjure,” for he expected those
little white cubes with the black spots to bring
him the money with which to make a loud noise
in Tickfall colored society.</p>

<p class='c005'>Popsy roused himself from his dreamy vacuity
and felt in his pocket for his tobacco-pouch. He
would take a little smoke before dinner. He found
the tobacco-pouch, also something else.</p>

<p class='c005'>He brought forth a green-plush box and looked
at it curiously. He opened it with hands which
shook from senile palsy and examined its contents.
It was a rabbit-foot surmounted with a
silver cap on one end. He wondered where he
had acquired the thing.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Come here, Shinny!” he called. “Look whut
I done found on myse’f.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Shin Bone crossed the room, gazed at the
treasure for a moment, and gave a surprised grunt.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Whar did you git dis rabbit-foot?” he inquired
suspiciously.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I dunno, Shinny,” the old man replied in a
complaining voice. “Whut is it fur?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Lots of folks has rabbit-foots,” Shin said. “I
<a id='Page_25'></a>don’t b’lieve in ’em. I got four, an’ dey don’t
fotch me no luck. Whar did you git dis’n?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I dunno.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Whar you been at to-day?” Shin asked.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, suh, early dis mawnin’ I went to de
Shoofly chu’ch an’ conversed de Revun Vinegar
Atts a little; atter dat, I went out to de Nigger-Heel
wid Mustard Prophet—ah—dat’s whar I
got dis here foot. Mustard gib it to me. He esplained
a whole lot about it an’ tole me dat Marse
Tom gib it to him, an’ he passed it on.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Whut yo gwine do wid it?” Shin asked.</p>

<p class='c005'>“’Tain’t no good to me,” Popsy whined, working
at his tobacco-pouch and shaking some tobacco
in his hand. “De only luck-charm I b’lieves in is
de chu’ch. Ef de good Lawd is on yo’ side, who
kin be agin you?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Shin Bone knew better than to get Popsy started
in a discussion of religion. His conversation on
that theme was interminable. Besides, the plush
box lying on the table between them had awakened
several interesting trains of thought:</p>

<p class='c005'>First, he knew Popsy had a trick of putting
things into his pocket and walking off with them,
forgetting where he acquired them, and even failing
to remember what they were for. Second, he
remembered that Mustard Prophet had often attributed
much of his good fortune to the possession
of a rabbit-foot. Thirdly, he knew that Colonel
Gaitskill also had a rabbit-foot, for he had often
<a id='Page_26'></a>heard him refer to it in his hearing and in the
presence of the other negroes.</p>

<p class='c005'>Now, did Popsy inadvertently take possession
of Gaitskill’s rabbit-foot? Or did he absent-mindedly
walk off with Mustard’s foot? Or did
Mustard give his famous luck-charm away? Shin
doubted this last supposition. If a luck-charm is
good, it is very, very good. Or did Mustard steal
Gaitskill’s rabbit-foot and Popsy take it from
Mustard?</p>

<p class='c005'>Popsy lighted his pipe and began to smoke.
Shin Bone decided that he could make nothing
of the mystery. A rabbit-foot was no good to him.
He had tried them before. But loaded dice, now—he
pulled the “bones” from his pocket and renewed
his former operations.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the kitchen a bell rang. A number of patrons
who had been lingering outside came through the
door and seated themselves at the table. Shin
Bone arose to bring in the dinner. Popsy knocked
the ashes from his pipe and got ready to eat.</p>

<p class='c005'>As for Org and Little Bit, they did not get back
to the Gaitskill home until the sun had sunk below
the line of the tree-tops. And not until Orren Randolph
Gaitskill beheld his sister sitting upon the
porch did he think of the errand on which she had
sent him ten hours before.</p>

<p class='c005'>His small hand investigated his trouser-pocket,
to see if he was still in possession of the fifty-cent
piece. He might have lost it when he tossed
<a id='Page_27'></a>aside his garments on the banks of the Cooley
bayou.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Org!” Virginia called sharply. “Where are
those stamps?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Org’s nervous fingers caressed the half-dollar in
his pocket. His mind reached out like the tentacles
of an octopus, grasping after an excuse.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Where are my stamps?” she repeated.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Er—ah—I went down-town,” Org began. “I
went down-town—and—er—ah—Miss Paunee,
that mustang woman in the post-office—she told
me—she said——”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well?” Virginia’s tone was icy.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Miss Paunee—she told me—ah—she said she
didn’t have no two-cent stamps; she had sold
out.”</p>

<p class='c005'>If the glance of a sister’s eye could kill, most
brothers would now be dead. Org survived the
look she gave him, and sheepishly offered her the
fifty-cent piece.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You don’t need no stamps, Gince,” Org said
soothingly. “Them guys you left behind ain’t
worth writing letters to.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Please keep your opinions to yourself,” his
sister advised. “Where have you spent the
day?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I have been to the Nigger-Heel plantation
with Little Bit. Little Bit is a colored person and
a very good friend. A colored man named Mustard
took me out in a wagon and brought me back,”
<a id='Page_28'></a>Org informed her. Then eagerly: “Say, Gince,
do you know that a negro is black all over his body,
even under his clothes?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Where did you meet these blacks?” Virginia
asked, avoiding Org’s question as to the color-line.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I met Little Bit at the foot of the hill. He
told me he was the captain’s white negro. I met
Mustard Prophet in front of the Hen-Scratch
saloon in Dirty-Six. We picked up Popsy Spout
at Shin Bone’s hot-cat stand in Hell’s Half-Acre!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Under this appalling summary of information,
Miss Virginia reeled back in dismay.</p>

<p class='c005'>“No doubt,” she said weakly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“If you want to save stamps, Gince,” Org suggested
eagerly, “you better write to Little Bit’s
captain and let me carry the notes for you. I saw
the captain when we were coming home. He’s
got a’ automobile as big as a street-car. He was
in the army and a German shot him——”</p>

<p class='c005'>A slight flush appeared on Miss Virginia’s cheek.
It spread slowly, like the unfurling of some flag—the
star-spangled banner for instance.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I don’t care to hear the personal history of the
acquaintances you have made to-day,” Miss
Virginia interrupted.</p>

<p class='c005'>“His name is Captain Kerley Kerlerac, Gince,”
Org persisted. “Little Bit told me. Little Bit,
my colored friend, is the captain’s pet coon.”</p>
<div>
  <a id='Page_29'></a>
  <h3 class='c010'>VI<br /> <br />THE RAFT</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>In Tickfall, religion was reduced to the least
common divisor. That is to say, there was one
church for the white people and one for the black.
The white children felt that they were imposed
upon by the older and more dominating members
of their families in that they were made to go to
Sunday-school, whereas, the black children were
permitted by their parents to grow up in that ignorance
which is bliss.</p>

<p class='c005'>Org had no particular love for religious instruction.
All the time that he was trying to learn a
sufficient portion of that day’s lesson to satisfy his
teacher, he was thinking of a buzzard’s nest which
Little Bit had told him about, a buzzard’s nest
which contained two baby buzzards, both of them
white as snow. If that buzzard’s nest had been
concealed in some Sunday-school book—but Org
never found anything interesting in a Sunday-school
book. What little he knew of that day’s
portion of the Scripture had been imparted to him
by the laborious efforts of his sister, and he was
now walking down the hill toward the church,
mumbling his newly acquired information to
himself.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Whar you gwine, Marse Org?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Sunday-school. Come and go with me.”</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_30'></a>“Ain’t fitten,” Little Bit giggled. “A little
black coon like me ain’t got no place in a white
chu’ch. Excusin’ dat, I janitors in a saloon, an’
Sunday-schools ain’t made fer such.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ll tell you all I know about the lesson,” Org
urged. “Listen: Methusalem—oldest man ever
was: nine hundred and sixty-nine years old—was
not, for God took him—gathered to his
fathers——”</p>

<p class='c005'>“How ole you say he wus gwine on when he
died?” Little Bit asked.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Nine hundred and sixty-nine years.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Whoop-ee! Whut did de ole gizzard die of
when he died?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I dunno,” Org replied. “He died of smoking
cigarettes, I reckon. If you go with me, we’ll ask
the teacher.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I mought stan’ outside behime de chu’ch while
you axed,” Little Bit said doubtfully. “Who am
dis here teacher?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Captain Kerley Kerlerac.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I ain’t gwine to no Sonday-school to ax my
boss nothin’,” Little Bit said positively. “Dat
white man don’t ’low no niggers to pesticate him
wid ’terrogations. I knows!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Org was not willing to part with his companion.
He could have a great deal more fun with Little
Bit than he could contemplating the career of a
man who had lived nearly a thousand years and
had been dead for several thousand more. Besides,
<a id='Page_31'></a>he was a little skeptical of the alleged age of
that old party. So when Org came to a corner
where he should have turned to the right, he turned
to the left, and from that time on there was a
vacant chair in the Sunday-school.</p>

<p class='c005'>The old cotton-shed on the edge of the Gaitskill
sand pit was the first thing to attract the attention
of the pair. In that storehouse, they
found an old cotton-truck, and a door which had
been torn off the hinges and was lying on the floor
near the office.</p>

<p class='c005'>They found amusement for a while by pulling
each other around on the truck. Then they sat
down in the door to cool off and gazed out over an
expanse of water which formed a shallow pond in
the sand pit.</p>

<p class='c005'>“If we could get this old broken-down door over
to that pond, we could have a raft to ride on,” Org
remarked.</p>

<p class='c005'>“’Tain’t no trouble,” Little Bit replied. “Jes’
load de door onto de cotton-truck an’ push de
truck down to de pond.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You are certainly intell’gent, Little Bit,” Org
exclaimed admiringly as he sprang to his feet.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Pushin’ things an’ liftin’ things an’ loadin’
things—dat’s a cullud pusson’s nachel-bawn job,”
Little Bit chuckled. “’Tain’t no trouble fer a
nigger to think up dat.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Let’s get this door on the truck and move our
raft,” Org urged.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_32'></a>It was not hard to do. The pine door was not
very heavy, and from the time they got it out of
the building, the route was down hill to the edge
of the pond. They pushed the truck into the
water, easily floated the door off, and then tugged
mightily to drag the truck back to the empty
storehouse again.</p>

<p class='c005'>They found two long poles which would serve
to steer with, and raced back to the edge of the
pond and climbed aboard their raft.</p>

<p class='c005'>The door sustained them just as long as most of
their weight was on their poles, and they were trying
to push off. At last they worked their raft
out to about four feet of water and felt free to lift
their steering-poles and ride.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then that door slowly sank under their weight
until the water was up to their knees, to their
waists, to their shoulders. It stopped in its downward
journey when it rested on the sandy bottom,
and the two lads stood on it, looking at each other
with the utmost astonishment, raising their chins
to keep the water out of their mouths.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You done got yo’ nice Sunday clothes all wet,”
Little Bit sighed.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yours are wet, too,” Org retorted.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dis here is my eve’y-day suit. I ain’t got
no all-Sonday gyarments. I wears dese ladylike
clothes all de time.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’m sorry you spoilt your only suit,” Org
sympathized.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_33'></a>“’Tain’t spiled—it’s jes’ wet,” Little Bit replied.
“Whut is us gwine do now?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“We’re both wet. We might as well have a
good time,” Org suggested philosophically.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I likes good times an’ dis’n is started off real
good,” Little Bit laughed. “You git offen dis ole
door an’ le’s see ef it will hold me up.”</p>
<h3 class='c010'>VII<br /> <br />LOST BOYS</h3>

<p class='c011'>About four o’clock that afternoon somebody in
the Gaitskill home asked where Orren Randolph
Gaitskill was. He had not been seen since he left the
house that morning to attend the Sunday-school.</p>

<p class='c005'>Miss Virginia Gaitskill called Captain Kerley
Kerlerac on the telephone and asked if Orren had
been in his class that morning.</p>

<p class='c005'>When a devilish boy happens to be the brother
of an angelic girl, even a disillusioned war-veteran
finds that lad possessed of qualities which he loves
and admires for the boy’s sister’s sake.</p>

<p class='c005'>Kerlerac informed her that he had missed Orren
very much, that he was the brightest boy in his
class, that all the others had made anxious inquiry
about him, that he was about to call at the Gaitskill
home to inquire if Orren was sick.</p>

<p class='c005'>The answer which he heard to this panegyric
was a giggle.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_34'></a>“Hello! Hello! What’s that?” he exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c005'>The telephone clicked in his ear, indicating that
she had hung up the receiver.</p>

<p class='c005'>Kerley stood at the telephone scratching his
head, a wry smile on his lips.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I believe that giggle meant that she called me a
liar,” he announced to his immortal soul. A reminiscent
light beamed in his eyes. “She hasn’t
changed in the past fifteen years—little spitfire!”</p>

<p class='c005'>For half an hour Miss Virginia found something
else to think about besides her wandering brother,
but as the evening wore on, and he did not appear,
she began to get uneasy again.</p>

<p class='c005'>“That dang boy has played hookey and gone out
in the woods with that pickaninny,” Colonel Gaitskill
announced.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, maybe he’s lost in the swamp!” Virginia
gasped.</p>

<p class='c005'>“No danger of that,” Gaitskill said easily.
“These little niggers around here can go across
that swamp like a fox. They can’t get lost.”</p>

<p class='c005'>But as the shadows lengthened across the Gaitskill
lawn the women of the household were thrown
into a panic. They insisted that it was not a
natural or ordinary thing for Orren to miss his
meals; that a hungry boy might be having a very
good time at some amusement, but he would always
be willing to postpone his play to eat, resuming his
play after this meal.</p>

<p class='c005'>“That’s so,” Gaitskill admitted. “When I was
<a id='Page_35'></a>a boy nothing was ever more attractive to me than
the consumption of food, and I enjoy being regular
at my meals now. But, maybe he ate his lunch
somewhere else?”</p>

<p class='c005'>By telephone they made inquiry of every place
where they thought Orren could have eaten. He
had not been seen at any of those places.</p>

<p class='c005'>Gaitskill saw that he was going to have to get
out and hunt that boy. The prospect did not
appeal to him. That boy was a nuisance. If he
was lost, it was good riddance. He wasn’t worth
finding—let him find himself. He went to the
telephone and called up Captain Kerley Kerlerac.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Say, Kerl, where’s that damn little pet nigger
of yours?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Haven’t seen him to-day, Colonel.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“He’s run off somewhere with Orren, and Orren
hasn’t come home yet.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ll find him,” Kerley said eagerly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, no! Don’t trouble yourself,” Gaitskill
smiled. “I just wanted to know about Little
Bit.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Gaitskill sat down with a sly grin. He was getting
old, he reflected, and the strenuous life was
no longer attractive. If a searching party should
have to be organized, he had now laid its foundation.
It was a certainty that Kerlerac would organize
the party and lead the search. Good old
Kerl would see that Virginia’s brother was not lost.</p>

<p class='c005'>It does not take a rumor long to spread over a
<a id='Page_36'></a>little village. In a brief time, it was known to the
remotest parts of Tickfall that Little Bit and Orren
Gaitskill were lost.</p>

<p class='c005'>Little Bit’s mother, in spite of the fact that she
had fourteen others just like him in her cabin,
aroused all the negro section of the town by her
frantic wails. She announced in a voice like a
calliope that she knew that her angel child had
fallen into a well, had been eaten by an alligator,
had been bitten by a snake, had been drowned in a
bayou, had been stolen and carried away by white
folks, had been lost in the swamp—and she howled
like a banshee over each one of these possibilities,
and others of the same general nature as she
thought of them.</p>

<p class='c005'>A great bellow of excitement went up from all
the negroes, and a band of them hurried to the
home of Captain Kerlerac to inquire the latest information
about Little Bit. Their excitement
was contagious, and the captain caught it, the
white citizens of the town were inoculated, and in
an incredibly short time the town was seething
with an intense desire to organize a search-party
and explore the woods for the lost boys.</p>

<p class='c005'>“We’ll wait until night, men,” Kerlerac said.
“If the boys don’t come in by dark, we will go
out on the Little Moccasin Road and build fires on
the highway for ten miles. Wherever they may be
in the swamp, they will see that trail of fire and
come to it.”</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_37'></a>“That’s the way to do it,” several approving
voices spoke.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Don’t bother Colonel Gaitskill with it,” Kerley
suggested. “He’s getting too old to be running
around at night and exposing himself. If the
boys don’t come in by dark, I will ring the court-house
bell. Meet me there.”</p>

<p class='c005'>It had not been very long since Kerlerac had
been a boy himself. He knew every spot in that
vicinity which was dear to boys, white and black.
He listed each one in his mind and started on a lone
search to each of these places.</p>

<p class='c005'>His automobile carried him first to all the swimming-holes,
then to the old picnic-grounds, then
to the old tabernacle, where the negro camp-meetings
were held, to the pool where the colored
members of the Shoofly church conducted their
baptizings, to the old stables and sheds around the
fair-grounds. Finally, he left his machine beside
the road and walked across the field to the old
cotton-shed beside the sand pit.</p>

<p class='c005'>The noise of shouting and laughter came to him
before he arrived upon the scene. It was no
trouble to locate the two boys as they splashed and
paddled and fought with water and dived to the
bottom to rise with a handful of sand to throw at
each other.</p>

<p class='c005'>Time had ceased to move for those two youngsters.
Sunrise and sunset were just the same to
them. A score of apple-cores strewn along the
<a id='Page_38'></a>sandy shore indicated that they had lunched well
and were not hungry.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Hey, you!” Kerley called.</p>

<p class='c005'>The two boys looked up with surprise.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Come out of that water!” Kerley commanded.
“Don’t you know it is nearly night?”</p>

<p class='c005'>The astonishment on their faces when informed
of the passage of time indicated that they
had been completely engrossed with their amusement.</p>

<p class='c005'>They climbed out of the water near Kerlerac and
gave that gentleman a surprise.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You’ve both got on your clothes!” he exclaimed.
“Are you too lazy to strip when you take a Sunday
swim?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Naw, suh. But our fust swim wus a mistake,
Marse Cap’n,” Little Bit chattered, chilled by the
wind after his day of activity in the water. “Us
got on a raff an’ de raff wouldn’t hol’ us up.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Don’t report to me,” Kerley laughed. “March
along home now! Right face! Forward!”</p>

<p class='c005'>A little later Kerlerac marched the two wet
youngsters upon the lawn and made them stand at
attention in the presence of a dozen hysterical
women.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Here are your mud-cats, Colonel,” he smiled.
“I found them paddling in the pond in the old
sand pit.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I didn’t intend to get wet, Uncle Tom,” Org
began, “but the raft was not large enough——”</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_39'></a>“That’s enough for you,” Gaitskill cut him off.
“Go around to the rear of the house.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Miss Virginia Gaitskill stood upon the steps
smiling.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I think I knew you once, Miss Gaitskill,”
Kerlerac said. “We were both younger then.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You were seven and I was five,” Virginia
smiled, as she extended her hand.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I remember,” Kerlerac answered. “You gave
me a chocolate rat with a rubber tail. I could
hold the tail and bounce the rat, or I could lay the
rat down and watch it wiggle its tail very lifelike.
I ate that rat, rubber-tail and all.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You gave me a rabbit-foot in a green-plush
box,” Virginia laughed. “I did not eat the foot
or the box. I have them both yet.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I have something that you did not give me,”
Kerlerac said earnestly. “I stole it from you. I
carried it through three battles across the sea. It
is your picture as you were then.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Have I changed since then?” the girl asked,
because she did not know what else to say.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes. The photograph I have of you shows a
little spitfire girl astride of a wabble-wheeled
velocipede.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh—” that young lady gasped.</p>
<div>
  <a id='Page_40'></a>
  <h3 class='c010'>VIII<br /> <br />THE LOST FOOT</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>A moving-picture of the performances of Mustard
Prophet when he discovered the loss of his
rabbit-foot would be a valuable contribution to
the silent drama. Alone in that big plantation-house,
with no one to talk to, he spluttered with
language like an erupting volcano, and cut as many
capers as a cat having a fit.</p>

<p class='c005'>After that he mounted the fastest horse on his
plantation and rode to town, sweeping down upon
his wife like a cyclone of wrath and fear and consternation.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dat ole bat stole dat rabbit-foot,” Mustard
bellowed.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I don’t b’lieve it,” Hopey replied, trying to
soothe him. “Dat’s a good ole man.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“He’s a good ole stealer,” Mustard howled.
“He knows how to rob de hen-roost an’ hide de
feathers. Lawd, when I think how heavy he sets
in de amen cornder of de Shoofly meetin’-house,
singin’ religion toons an’ foolin’ de people all de time—I
tell you dat nigger ought to be churched!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But I don’t see what he wanted to take dat
rabbit-foot fer,” Hopey declared. “He’s tole me
plenty times dat he didn’t b’lieve in foots; he
b’lieves in faith.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It’s wuth a thousan’ dollars—dat how come
<a id='Page_41'></a>he took it!” Mustard bawled. “Mebbe it’s wuth
a millyum; how does I know? Marse Tom, he’s
got it all fixed up wid silver trimmin’s an’ in a
plush box. Dat ain’t no cheap, common, nigger
rabbit-foot. Dat’s a royal rabbit-foot, an’ it
fotch Marse Tom all de luck he ever had. He tole
me dat his own self.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why don’t you go to Popsy an’ ax him fer it?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dat ole lyin’ thief will say he ain’t got it, an’
ain’t never had it, an’ don’t know nothin’ about
it,” Mustard wailed. “Atter dat, whar is I at?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Tell him dat it b’longs to Marse Tom, an’ you
want it back,” Hopey urged.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yep. An’ dat ole gizzard will swell up an’
sw’ar he ain’t got nothin’ of Marse Tom’s an’ offer
to go down to de bank an’ prove it befo’ Marse
Tom’s own face. I don’t dast let Marse Tom
know I done loss dat rabbit-foot. De kunnel
would kill me dead!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I never thought of dat,” Hopey sighed.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You don’t think about nothin’,” Mustard
wailed. “Here I is in de wuss mess I’m ever got
into, an’ you ain’t think about nothin’. Look at
dis here jam. If Marse Tom finds out I loss de
rabbit-foot, he’ll kill me; ef I ax dat ole Popsy-sneak
to gib it back, mebbe he’ll blab dat it’s lost,
an’ Marse Tom will hear about it, an’ I’ll git kilt
jes’ de same. Anyhow, dat foot is plum’ gone
an’——”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why don’t you git somebody to git it back fer
<a id='Page_42'></a>you?” Hopey asked. “Ef Popsy stole it, it ’pears
to me like somebody oughter be able to steal it
back.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Suttinly, ef dey kin find it,” Mustard said, the
light of new hope shining in his eyes. “I’d gib
somebody one hundred dollars to steal it back fer
me agin.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dat’s plenty lib’ral,” Hopey said. “Mebbe
ef you’ll hunt aroun’ you kin find somebody.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Mustard quieted down and gave himself to deep
meditation, trying to think of someone sufficiently
bold to hold up Popsy and extract the treasure
from his pocket.</p>

<p class='c005'>Hopey took this opportunity to leave the room.
She had heard a great deal from Mustard, and she
did not care to be around when he began to mourn
and lament again. She was a fat woman, and desired
calm environments, and sought the ways of
peace. Moreover, she did not attribute the same
value to the rabbit-foot that Mustard did. It
seemed to her that Gaitskill had given it to
Mustard to keep for his own, and that he cared
nothing for it, had forgotten all about it; he could
not attach much importance to its possession when
he had never made inquiry about it in all the time
that Mustard had guarded it so zealously.</p>

<p class='c005'>But Mustard was the best negro overseer in
Louisiana for this reason as much as any other:
he took care of things, regarded his employer’s
property as more valuable even than his own, and
<a id='Page_43'></a>everything belonging to Marse Tom was to be kept
in order for the day when he should give an account
of his stewardship.</p>

<p class='c005'>After a while, Hopey thought of her friend, Dazzle
Zenor. Dazzle had good sense, possessed the
wisdom which comes from many varied experiences,
and she would be able to help her now. She
heard certain noises in the next room, which indicated
that Mustard was getting ready to explode
again, so she hastily left the house and went to
town.</p>

<p class='c005'>Dazzle lived in Ginny Babe Chew’s boardinghouse
in Dirty-Six. So Hopey climbed pantingly
to the second floor of this house and knocked on
her door.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Who’s dat?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Hopey Prophet is done come on bizzness. Open
dis door!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Whut you come to see me fur?” Dazzle asked
promptly, after she had admitted Hopey.</p>

<p class='c005'>Dazzle was a woman who met all the exactions
of Ethiopian beauty. Her skin as black as jet, her
teeth like milk, her eyes so dark that they had a
bluish tinge, slim and strong and graceful, an
actress, a dancer, a singer, she was the dusky belle
of Tickfall. Every negro man who had married
anybody in the past four years had first proposed
to and been rejected by Dazzle.</p>

<p class='c005'>Many of Dazzle’s enterprises were highly adventurous,
and she was always fearful and suspicious.
<a id='Page_44'></a>So when Hopey hesitated to begin,
Dazzle’s tone became sharp with anxiety:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Whut you come to see me fur?” she repeated.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I come to consult wid you about a little scrape
our fambly is got into, Dazzle,” Hopey began. “Us
is liable to hab plenty trouble onless somebody kin
he’p us.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Whut’s done busted loose now?” Dazzle asked
easily. Her mind was now at rest, for nothing
that could happen to Hopey’s family could impinge
on any of Dazzle’s previous escapades.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Mustard is done loss his rabbit-foot!” Hopey
exclaimed in tragic tones.</p>

<p class='c005'>Dazzle laughed.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ll gib Mustard a hatful of dem things. I’m
got about twenty.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But dis here is a royal rabbit-foot,” Hopey
said with emphasis.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I never heerd of dat kind, but ’tain’t no ’count
whutever it is,” Dazzle smiled. “I done tried all
kinds, an’ I knows.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But dis rabbit-foot b’longed to Marse Tom
Gaitskill,” Hopey informed her, “an’ Mustard
lost it, an’ Marse Tom will kill Mustard ef he don’t
git it back.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No doubts,” Dazzle chuckled. “White folks
ain’t got no real good sense, an’ nobody cain’t tell
whut dey will do.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then Dazzle listened while Hopey told the tale
of the disappearance of the rabbit-foot. Dazzle
<a id='Page_45'></a>was not much impressed with this story of another’s
misfortune, but at the last one sentence
stimulated her interest:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Mustard says he will pay one hundred dollars
to whoever gits his foot back.”</p>

<p class='c005'>That was speaking in language which Dazzle
could understand. She sprang to her feet.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ll earn dat hundred dollars right now,” Dazzle
proclaimed. “I’ll go out to Popsy’s cabin an’
pull his nose till he gibs up dat foot.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“’Tain’t possible, Dazzle,” Hopey said. “We
don’t want Marse Tom to know dat de foot is lost.
Ef you go to pullin’ noses an’ skinnin’ shins, Popsy
will beller, an’ Marse Tom will hear about dat.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“He’d shore howl,” Dazzle agreed, reluctantly
abandoning that plan. “Well, I’ll go out and
make love to dat ole man, an’ sneak de rabbit-foot
outen his pocket.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Any way will do dat will git de foot back ’thout
makin’ too much of a rookus, Dazzle,” Hopey
said. “We don’t want no row, no nigger scrape,
no loud noise, and no white folks mixin’ in.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“White folks is shore good mixers,” Dazzle
said, wincing at the recollection of several plans
of hers which had been rudely frustrated by the
interference of the whites. “I’ll see whut I kin
do.”</p>
<div>
  <a id='Page_46'></a>
  <h3 class='c010'>IX<br /> <br />SKEETER BUTTS</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>At the time that Hopey was in conversation
with Dazzle Zenor, Mustard was in deep thought.
At last a name came into his darkened and
troubled mind which was like a blaze of light illuminating
all his perplexities: “Skeeter Butts!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Ten minutes later he entered the Hen-Scratch
saloon and was told that the man he sought was in
a little room in the rear.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’m shore glad to find you so easy, Skeeter,”
Mustard said in a relieved tone. “Ef you had
been out of town I would hab fotch’ my troubles
to you jes’ the same, whar you wus.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dis is whar you gits exputt advices on ev’ything,”
Skeeter laughed as he sat down and lighted
a cigarette.</p>

<p class='c005'>Why is it that people make confidants of barkeeps?</p>

<p class='c005'>And whom will we tell our troubles to when the
world is made safe for prohibition?</p>

<p class='c005'>Skeeter was a saddle-colored, dapper, petite
negro, the dressiest man of any color who ever
lived in Tickfall. His hair was always closely
clipped, the part made in the middle of his head
with a razor. His collars were so high that they
made him look like a jackass, with his chin hanging
over a whitewashed fence. His clothes were
<a id='Page_47'></a>so loud that they invariably proclaimed the man
a block away.</p>

<p class='c005'>He was the “pet nigger” of all the well-to-do
white people in the town, who invariably took him
upon their hunting and fishing trips; his dancing,
singing, gift of mimicry, and certain histrionic
gifts had given him a place in many amateur
theatrical exhibitions in Tickfall, among both
whites and blacks; and with all his monkey trickery
he, nevertheless, had the confidence of all the
white people, and could walk in and out of more
houses without a question being asked as to the
reason for his presence there than any white or
black in the little village.</p>

<p class='c005'>Among the negroes he was Sir Oracle. He was
matrimonial adjuster in courtship, marriage, and
divorce; he was confidential adviser at baptisms
and funerals; his expert advice was sought in all
matters pertaining to lodge and church and social
functions. In short, he represented in Tickfall
colored society what Colonel Gaitskill did among
the white people.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dis is whar you gits exputt advices on eve’ything,”
Skeeter laughed, for he knew his standing
among his people.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I don’t want advices. I wants a hold-up man,”
Mustard said gloomily.</p>

<p class='c005'>“How come?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“A feller stole somepin from me, an’ I wants
somebody to steal it back,” Mustard explained.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_48'></a>“Bawl out wid it,” Skeeter snapped. “Don’t
go beatin’ de bush aroun’ de debbil. Talk sense!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Mustard hesitated for a long time, opened his
mouth once or twice as if about to speak, shook his
head, and seemed to think better of it.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well,” Skeeter snapped, “why don’t you tell
it?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I don’t know how to begin,” Mustard sighed.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Begin at de fust part an’ tell dat fust,” Skeeter
ranted. “Is you been hittin’ Marse Tom’s bottle?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Under this sort of prodding, continued for some
time longer, Skeeter finally got Mustard started,
and got the story. It is not necessary to repeat
it, although Mustard’s way of telling what happened
and what he thought of Popsy would be
interesting.</p>

<p class='c005'>“An’ now, Skeeter,” Mustard concluded, “de
idear is dis: Popsy stole my rabbit-foot, an’ I want
you to steal it back. Rob de ole man of my foot
an’ fotch it back to me, an’ I’ll gib you one hundred
dollars.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Pay in eggsvance?” Skeeter asked eagerly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“No,” Mustard said.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Bestow a little money in eggsvance to keep my
mind int’rusted.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Suttinly. Ten dollars cash down—you got to
pay it back ef you don’t do no good.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ll git de foot all right,” Skeeter said confidently.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Don’t be too shore, Skeeter,” Mustard warned
<a id='Page_49'></a>him. “You might git in jail, an’ ef you does, don’t
ax me to he’p you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You means to say ef I bust into ole Popsy’s
cabin an’ steal de foot, an’ he gits me arrested, you
won’t esplain nothin’ to de cote-house?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Nary a single esplain!” Mustard proclaimed
solemnly. “Dat’s jes’ whut I means. I ain’t
gwine git mixed up in dis no way an’ no how! Ef
you gits in jail, I won’t open my mouth ef dey
hangs you on a tree.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Skeeter pulled out of his pocket the ten-dollar
bill which Mustard had just given him and spread
it out upon his knee, smoothing it with his yellow
fingers.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Gimme fo’ more ten-dollar bills to spread out
on top of dis tenner,” Skeeter commanded.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mustard promptly handed over the money.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dis here detecative stealin’ job is a risky bizzness,”
Skeeter proclaimed. “I ain’t never got at
nothin’ yit as dangersome.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I knows it, Skeeter,” Mustard agreed gloomily.
“Ef you ain’t keerful, you’ll git a bullet in you;
an’ ef dat sad misforchine happens to you I won’t
even come to yo’ fun’ral. I ain’t gwine mix wid
dis at all.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Mustard arose, walked through the barroom,
climbed upon his horse, and departed for the Nigger-Heel
plantation.</p>

<p class='c005'>Skeeter sat for a long time, considering all that
Mustard had told him, the money still spread out
<a id='Page_50'></a>upon his knee. Then he arose and pocketed the
money, walked out to the rear, and sat down in a
chair under his favorite china-berry tree.</p>

<p class='c005'>Two boys up the street diverted his attention
for a moment. They had a long, black bullwhip,
and were taking turn-about trying to see who
could “pop” it the loudest. The “cracker” on
the whip was nearly worn off, and they decided to
plait an entirely new cracker, one that would pop
like a pistol. Neither had a pocket-knife, and
they could find nothing with which to remove the
old cracker. They tried to saw it off with a piece
of sharp glass, abandoned that in favor of a piece
of sharp-edged tin can, then took a sharp rock and
tried to beat it off.</p>

<p class='c005'>When they saw Skeeter Butts they swooped
down on him.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Lend us de loant of yo’ pocket-knife, Skeeter,”
Little Bit asked.</p>

<p class='c005'>Skeeter thrust his hand into his pocket, found
nothing, and answered:</p>

<p class='c005'>“I left it inside de barroom. I’m glad of it, because
you’s be shore to cut yourselfs.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Skeeter leaned his chair against the tree, sat
down, and placed the heels of his shoes in the front
rungs of the chair, tipped his hat down over his
eyes until the bridge of his nose was invisible, and
sat motionless. Except the tiny column of smoke
that curled up from his cigarette, there was
scarcely a sign of life.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_51'></a>The two boys wandered around to the front of
the saloon. Then a bright idea came to Little
Bit:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Marse Org, less git a match an’ burn de cracker
offen dis ole whup.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Where’s the match?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Little Bit led him into the saloon and conducted
him to the little room in the rear. There, upon a
table, they found a box of matches, and Org struck
one and applied it to the cracker, while Little Bit
held the whip.</p>

<p class='c005'>The cracker easily caught fire and burned freely.
When it was near to the rawhide end of the lash
Little Bit gave the whip a quick jerk and the flaming
cracker flew off the end. The boys laughed
at the success of their plan, picked up a handful
of twine strings which lay around the floor, and
walked out.</p>

<p class='c005'>Boylike, they never looked to see where the flaming
cracker went. They didn’t care where it went.
They didn’t want it. They went out the way they
had come, and ran up the street and far away.</p>

<p class='c005'>Skeeter was undisturbed until Dazzle Zenor
passed and roused him.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I got a big job befo’ me,” she said.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Me, too,” Skeeter replied.</p>

<p class='c005'>“My job am a secret,” Dazzle offered.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Mine, too,” Skeeter responded.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’s fixin’ to make a good bunch of money,”
Dazzle boasted.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_52'></a>“I’ll either make money or git in jail,” Skeeter
said. “I’m got a detecative job.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“My job is harder,” Dazzle smiled. “I pick
pockets.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I bet you is flirtin’ wid a jail, too,” Skeeter
asserted.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Mebbe so. I cain’t tell you no more——”</p>

<p class='c005'>Suddenly she stopped and stared at the closed
door in the rear of the saloon through which tiny
spirals of smoke were issuing by way of the cracks.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Is you fumigatin’, Skeeter?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Fumigatin’ whut?” Skeeter asked, then ran to
the door and threw it open.</p>

<p class='c005'>The room was filled with smoke and a pile of old
trash and newspapers in one corner was ablaze.</p>

<p class='c005'>With a loud whoop, Skeeter and Dazzle ran
through the smoke to the fire; from the door which
entered into the barroom, Figger Bush came in
with a bucket of water, yelling like a wild man. It
was all over in a minute.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Good-by, Skeeter!” Dazzle laughed. “Mebbe
us’ll meet in jail.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dat fire is a bad sign for me, Dazzle,” Skeeter
sighed. “Troubles is gittin’ ready to happen to
me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Things will shore happen whar a white boy an’
a pickaninny monkeys aroun’,” Dazzle told him.</p>
<div>
  <a id='Page_53'></a>
  <h3 class='c010'>X<br /> <br />RABBIT TOBACCO</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>When the inveterate smoker throws away a
pipe, it may be safely presumed that the pipe has
some potency. A briar-root sweetens with age,
mellowing and ripening in its own nicotine, and
then it becomes impossible. So it happened that
Colonel Gaitskill was compelled to an act of abandonment.
The pipe that had solaced him for
years was hurled far over in a clump of weeds in
the horse-pasture.</p>

<p class='c005'>One pair of sharp eyes saw the act of abandonment
and watched to see where the pipe fell. One
pair of nimble feet carried their owner to the spot
where the forsaken thing had fallen. A pair of
eager hands laid hold upon it, and Orren Randolph
Gaitskill found himself in proud possession of a
real pipe.</p>

<p class='c005'>If Orren’s Sunday-school teacher had arrived at
that particular moment and had been disposed to
instruct this youth upon the injurious effects of
nicotine, he could have run a broom-straw down
the stem of that pipe and brought it out all black
and shiny with poison. Finding a cat who never
had smoked, did not even “chaw,” he could have
forced that straw between pussy’s teeth, drawing
it lengthwise through the sides of her mouth, thus
wiping off the nicotine upon her tongue. He
could then have waited a few minutes and had a
<a id='Page_54'></a>free show for himself and Orren Randolph Gaitskill:
the exhibition of a suffering cat, dying
miserably in a fit.</p>

<p class='c005'>But, no! Orren had not the remotest idea of
permitting a cat, or even a Sunday-school teacher,
to share the delights of that pipe with him. He
intended to smoke it in exclusive partnership with
his colored friend, Little Bit.</p>

<p class='c005'>Orren found Little Bit sitting on a curb-stone
in front of the Hen-Scratch saloon, and exhibited
the treasure.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dat’s a purty good pipe, but whar’s yo’ terbacker?”
Little Bit asked.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You ought to furnish that,” Org replied. “I’ve
got the pipe and the matches.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I ain’t got none.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Don’t yo’ mammy smoke?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Naw. She dips.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Don’t your father smoke?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ain’t got no paw. He’s daid.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, then: can’t you borrow a little tobacco
from some of your friends?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ain’t got no frien’s, excusin’ you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What about Skeeter Butts?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“He ain’t no frien’ of our’n. He’s mad at us
because we sot his saloom on fire wid dat hot
whup-cracker.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I never saw a colored person with as little as
you have,” Orren said irascibly. “You haven’t
got nothin’.”</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_55'></a>“Dat’s a fack. Dat’s de nachel way niggers is.
But I knows whar dar is plenty rabbit terbacker.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That’s as good as any, I’m sure,” Org said.
“Lead me to it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>A short distance on the edge of the town, Little
Bit led Org into a wide pasture, along the edge of
which there ran a little branch. He hunted a few
minutes in search of a plant which is known in
other places as “life everlasting,” but in Louisiana
is called “rabbit tobacco.”</p>

<p class='c005'>This can be said for it: the oldest pipe-user,
dying for want of a smoke, will not smoke the
weed called life everlasting. He lets rabbit
tobacco alone. It has the flavor and the odor
of tobacco. It also has an effect, when used,
which invariably reminds every man of the time
when he smoked his first cigar.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dar she is!” Little Bit exclaimed, pouncing
upon a dry weed. “Dis here plant will gib us aplenty.”</p>

<p class='c005'>He stripped off the dry leaves, crushed them in
his hands and, assisted by Org, he packed the pipe-bowl.
They walked to the edge of a little thicket
and sat down upon a convenient log to enjoy their
smoke. A long, level pasture stretched out before
them, dotted here and there with grazing
cattle, ending across the way with a rail fence, beside
which grew a row of trees.</p>

<p class='c005'>Org produced a box of matches, laid it upon the
ground beside him, and reached out for the pipe.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_56'></a>“I’ll light up and smoke awhile, Little Bit.
Then I’ll pass it to you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Hit away, Marse Org. I ain’t really hankerin’
fer no pipe-smoke. I likes cigareets best. But
I’ll go it a puff or two, ef you’ll puff fust.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Org lighted the pipe and was charmed at the
ease with which he could draw the smoke through
the stem. The smoke was exceptionally sweet
and cooling to the tongue, like the flavor of ether,
although Org had never tasted that volatile fluid.
He took four or five hearty puffs, and then felt
that it was time to introduce his black friend to
this charming and delightful accomplishment.</p>

<p class='c005'>Little Bit had counted the number of times that
Org had blown the smoke from his lips and he had
too much regard for his “raisin’” to puff a single
time more than his white companion. After four
draws he handed back the pipe.</p>

<p class='c005'>Org reached for it with a disinterested hand.
He held the pipe listlessly and gazed out dreamily
upon the level meadow with eyes which saw little
and comprehended less and were not interested in
that. Then the pipe dropped from his hands, and
Org opened his eyes wide, as he suddenly beheld the
entire pasture with all its grazing cattle, the fence
with the trees at the far end—everything, in fact,
rise up in the air and dance high above his head!</p>

<p class='c005'>Org leaned back so far to behold the last of this
phenomenon that he fell off the log and lay prone
upon the ground.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_57'></a>“Whut ails you, Marse Org?” Little Bit asked
solicitously. “Is de worl’ done turned down-side
up fer you, too?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Little Bit arose with the intention of helping his
white companion, the entire earth tipped and
rolled over on him and pushed him over the log,
where he lay holding to the ground to keep from
being pitched off.</p>

<p class='c005'>One hour later the two boys crawled up on the
log and sat down, trembling, weak, beyond any
weakness they had ever experienced.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I guess we got poisoned with something,
Little Bit,” Org remarked. “I feel pretty
bad.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dar ain’t been many cullud folks as sick as I
wus an’ lived through it,” Little Bit replied with
weak boastfulness. “Niggers is like a mule: dey
don’t git sick but one time an’ atter dat, dey die. I
wus wuss off in de last hour dan I ever is been.
It muss hab been somepin I et.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I been heap sicker than you were,” Org declared.
“You lived through it—you say so yourself.
But me, I’m dying now!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dis ain’t no fitten place to die, Marse Org,”
Little Bit protested. “De buzzards will eat us up
out here all unbeknownst to nobody. Less mosey
back to town whar people kin see us die an’ keep
de buzzards off.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Less hurry. I ain’t got long to live,” Org
declared.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_58'></a>“We moves now,” Little Bit sighed miserably.
“Dis wus shore a narrer escapement fer us.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Locomotion was a difficult task for both of them.
They were glad when they came to the fence and
could use a stick with one hand and cling to the
fence with the other. When they reached the
road, they made wild and desperate gestures and
stopped a little automobile.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Whar you fellers been at?” Skeeter Butts
asked as he opened the door for them to climb in
beside him. “You look all peeked up.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Me an’ Marse Org, we been smokin’ rabbit
terbacker,” Little Bit told him.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ho! Ho! He! He!” Skeeter Butts howled.
“I done dat trick once myself. You-alls gwine try
it agin?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Naw, suh.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I reckin not,” Skeeter laughed. “I tried
smokin’ dat stuff twenty year ago an’ right now
whenever I sees a bush of dat rabbit terbacker, I
grabs a tree an’ begins to heave!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Skeeter turned his machine and started back to
Tickfall.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Whar you want me to take you?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Home, quick!” Org sighed.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Drap me at de Hen-Scratch,” Little Bit
begged. “I ain’t got de cornstitution to ride no
furder.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Skeeter drove to Gaitskill’s home, lifted Org out
of the machine and carried him to the porch. Org
<a id='Page_59'></a>promptly stretched out flat on his back on the
porch floor and called:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Gince! Oh, Gince! Come here and help me!
I’m dying!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Coming in answer to his call, Miss Virginia’s
face at first assumed an expression of fright at the
sight of Org, then, glancing at Skeeter’s grinning
mug, her uneasiness vanished.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What have you been doing?” she asked Org.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Smoking,” Org confessed. “Smoking a
pipe!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Where is that pipe?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Org thrust a trembling hand into the pocket of
his coat and produced the briar-root.</p>

<p class='c005'>“The idea!” Miss Virginia snapped, looking at
the pipe with loathsome repugnance. “What else
have you in your pockets? Let me see!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Org turned the pockets of his trousers wrong
side out and a number of strange and nameless
things rolled out, things which could have value
only in the eyes of a boy.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Turn out your coat pockets!” Virginia commanded.</p>

<p class='c005'>Org thrust his hand into his coat and handed
Virginia a green-plush box.</p>

<p class='c005'>The eyes of Skeeter Butts nearly popped out of
his head.</p>

<p class='c005'>“For goodness’ sake!” Virginia exclaimed in an
angry voice as she seized the box.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I was carrying it for luck, Gince,” Org said
<a id='Page_60'></a>apologetically. “Little Bit said it was lucky, but—oh,
I feel so sick!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Virginia opened the box and brought forth a
rabbit-foot surmounted on one end with silver.
Finding that it had not been injured, she spoke in
a mollified tone:</p>

<p class='c005'>“After this, you understand that this plush box
is mine, young man! Don’t you ever touch it
again!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I won’t. It ain’t no good.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Skeeter,” she said. “Carry Org up-stairs to
my room. I’ll lead the way.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Skeeter lifted the prostrate boy and carried him
where his sister led. He lingered around the bed
where he had placed Org until he saw Miss Virginia
open the drawer of a dressing-table and place the
green-plush box within it and shut the drawer.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You wants me to git de dorctor, Miss Virginny?”
Skeeter asked.</p>

<p class='c005'>“No. That will be all for you, thank you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>When Skeeter stepped out upon the road beside
the house, he noticed Colonel Gaitskill out in the
horse-pasture, walking around in a circle defined
by a clump of grass, his eyes glued upon the ground
as if he was hunting for something.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Have you done loss somepin, Marse Tom?”
Skeeter inquired as he walked to where he was.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes. I had a pipe that I have smoked for
twenty years. I threw it out in these weeds this
morning and bought a new pipe. But the new
<a id='Page_61'></a>pipe is an abomination. I’m looking for the old
one.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I think young Marse Org is got dat ole one,”
Skeeter laughed. “Miss Virginny jes’ now tuck
it offen him an’ lef’ it on de front porch.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Gaitskill stooped and broke off the stem of a
weed. He stripped the leaves from the straight
stem, crushed them, and sniffed at the peculiar,
sweetish, tobacco odor.</p>

<p class='c005'>Skeeter caught the scent, reeled backward,
clutched at his throat, grabbed a convenient tree
and began to heave!</p>
<h3 class='c010'>XI<br /> <br />AT AUCTION</h3>

<p class='c011'>When Skeeter Butts informed Mustard Prophet
that his coveted rabbit-foot was in the Gaitskill
home, Mustard nearly went into hysterics.</p>

<p class='c005'>“My Gawd!” he wailed. “No tellin’ whut dem
white chillun will do to dat foot—an’ mebbe I
won’t never see it agin.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dey ain’t gwine hurt it—Marse Tom’s house
is safer dan a bank!” Skeeter protested.</p>

<p class='c005'>“How’ll I ever git dat foot back outen dat
house?” Mustard howled. “Of co’se de house is
safer dan a bank. Us cain’t rob a white folk’s
house.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“How come you want it back ef it b’longs to
Marse Tom?” Skeeter asked.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_62'></a>“It’s dis way, Skeeter,” Mustard said, trying
to explain. “Eve’ything dat Marse Tom trusts
to me, I keeps jes’ like it is when he gibs it to me.
Ef he hands me a door-key, he needn’t ax me fer
dat key fer ten year, but when he do, I’ll gib him
dat key! Now, he gimme dat foot fifteen year ago,
an’ he ain’t never mentioned dat foot since dat
time nor seed it endurin’ all dem years; but ef he
wuster come to de Nigger-Heel to-morrer an’ ax
me, ‘Mustard, whar’s my rabbit-foot?’ my insides
would bust open an’ be outsides onless I
could say: ‘Here she am!’”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I sees,” Skeeter Butts said. “You’s got a rep
wid Marse Tom.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dat’s right. I’s tryin’ not to ruin my rep.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I wish I’d ’a’ knowed dat little white boy had
dat foot in his pocket,” Skeeter sighed. “I’d ’a’
picked his pocket or heldt him up or somepin’ like
dat.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Too late fer dat now,” Mustard mourned.
“Dat white boy found dat rabbit-foot down at ole
Popsy’s cabin. Popsy lives back on de Gaitskill
place in a cabin Marse Tom gib him, an’ dem
pickaninnies wus playin’ aroun’ dar an’ swiped it.
An’ ef Marse Tom ever ketches on dat I wus so
keerless wid his royal foot dat I let a bat like ole
Popsy git holt of it an’ run away wid it, an’ den let
it git in de hands of dem chillun—Oh, Lawdy!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Tears ran down the cheeks of Mustard Prophet.
The loss of the luck-charm was a real tragedy to
<a id='Page_63'></a>Mustard, for his life had been one of absolute
fidelity in little things.</p>

<p class='c005'>Every Southern man knows that the most unaccountable
paradox in negro nature and character
lies right here: you may choose the trickiest
negro thief in Louisiana, give him the key to your
money-chest, go to Europe and stay ten years, and
when you return the negro will hand you the key,
and the contents of the chest will be intact. Doubtless,
he will open the chest a hundred times and
investigate everything within it, but he will not
betray his trust. Then, having surrendered the
key and given an account of his stewardship, as he
goes through the hall on the way out, he might
pick up your gold-headed cane, stick it down his
pants’ leg and hike!</p>

<p class='c005'>But Mustard had always kept his record straight
in all respects. He was faithful in that which was
much and in that which was least. And now that
his rabbit-foot had got in Gaitskill’s home, he
found it impossible to stay away from that house.
He must get it back before Gaitskill discovered
it there and asked questions. He dared not tell
Hopey where it had been located, for Hopey had an
openwork mind and a garrulous mouth, and she
might let something drop that would reveal the
secret.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mustard devoted his days to service on the
Nigger-Heel plantation and came to town every
night. He had to ride fourteen miles to make the
<a id='Page_64'></a>round trip every twenty-four hours, but he felt
easier if he could only be near the house where his
rabbit-foot was concealed.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was summer time, growing time, with the
cotton “laid by.” Not much work to be done on
the plantation and a great many days as well as
nights could be spent in town. His presence
around the Gaitskill house attracted no comment,
for Mustard and his fat spouse had been associated
with the Gaitskill family since the day they were
born. They were as much of the place as the trees
that grew on the lawn and their presence was no
more unusual.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mustard, in the rôle of Hopey’s helper, contrived
to run a great many errands up and down the back
stairs of the Gaitskill house, trying with each trip
to get closer to his luck-charm, at least close
enough to see it and to know that it was still there
and safe. But he could never muster quite enough
courage to enter Miss Virginia Gaitskill’s private
room.</p>

<p class='c005'>Saturday afternoon came, the afternoon when
every negro in Louisiana who can acquire a little
money to spend when he gets to town, puts on his
best clothes and leaves the plantation.</p>

<p class='c005'>Each village fills up with colored folks. Each
darkey has his own idea of what constitutes fine
dress and on this parade he sees no reason for wearing
something showy without being able to show it.
If he wears a red undershirt he keeps his overshirt
<a id='Page_65'></a>unbuttoned so the showy thing will show. If he
wears a pair of red socks, he keeps his trousers
rolled up nearly to his knees, and sometimes one
can see a hundred negroes who look like they are
fixed for wading. If he possesses a colored handkerchief,
be sure to look for it in the upper pocket
of his coat, one corner sticking out!</p>

<p class='c005'>If he has anything to sell, he brings it to town.
Stock is auctioned upon the street, horses are
swapped, lies are exchanged, knives, pistols, “gamblin’-hands,”
conjures, and luck charms, all exchange
owners.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mustard mingled with this crowd in gloomy preoccupation.
His mind and his heart were centered
upon a green-plush box in the top dresser-draw of
a young lady’s boudoir—as inaccessible, so it
seemed to him, as the moon!</p>

<p class='c005'>A number of men converged, forming a laughing
crowd in front of the court-house, and listened to
the raucous voice of an auctioneer:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Old Jinx” was for sale by auction.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Gentlemen, this here is a mule that is known
to everybody in this parish. He’s got the legs on
him and he’s got the bones on him, and he’s got a
good, sound mind in a good, sound body, both
ripened by long years of toil and experience. Some
of you remember when Jinx first came to Tickfall
Parish, but none of you can remember how old Jinx
is now and how old he was when you first saw him.
You can estimate the age of a cow by the rings on
<a id='Page_66'></a>her horns and the age of a tree by the concentric
rings on its trunk, and the age of a horse or mule by
the teeth. But Jinx is an exception to all rules.
He’s a mystery. He has no pride of ancestry, no
hope of posterity, and his future is behind him.
How much am I bid for Jinx?”</p>

<p class='c005'>There were guffaws of laughter and sly jokes
passed among the men, but there were no bidders.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Don’t be afraid of Jinx, gentlemen!” the auctioneer
pleaded. “He’s done a lot of work in his
time and he’s got a lot more work in his system if
anybody can get it out. He’s perfectly harmless,
a woman or a child can drive him or ride him or
work him in the field. He’s as deaf as a post, so
you can cuss him in any known language without
causing offense to the cussee. He’s nearly a hundred
years old, I reckon, but his age ain’t nothing
against him. I knew a man who was one hundred
years old and he married a woman who was ninety
years old and they had a little baby that was born
with a pair of spectacles on his nose and a full set
of teeth. How much am I bid for Jinx?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Five dollars!” some wag shouted.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Five! Five! Five! I’m bid five!” the auctioneer
began with a monotonous, bark-like chant.
“Five dollars, I’m bid, only five! Somebody
make it six, make it six, make it six! Six dollars—somebody
bid six, as a token of love and esteem
for old Jinx—the only mule which has survived
the Civil War, the Spanish-American War, the
<a id='Page_67'></a>recent Mexican War, and the mule behind that
dragged the guns in the great world war.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Veteran and survivor of four great wars, and
yet this mule never smelt powder or heard a cap
pop! This mule with all his rich and varied experiences,
is like a feller who spends a dollar riding
on a merry-go-round. He spends all his money,
gets off at the same place he got on, and where’s
he been at? Nothing but a round trip for Jinx!
To my positive knowledge, I’ve auctioned him off
in front of this court-house twenty-two times in
the past twenty-two years! Am I bid six?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Six!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then began the monotonous pleading and
chanting of the auctioneer, his singsong appeal
for seven dollars, interspersed with feeble jokes
about Jinx.</p>

<p class='c005'>As he stood leaning against a tree in listless inattention,
Mustard Prophet saw Miss Virginia
Gaitskill pass in an automobile with Captain
Kerley Kerlerac. Ten minutes later he saw Mrs.
Gaitskill enter the Tickfall bank, of which Colonel
Gaitskill was president. Casting his eyes about
him, he beheld Orren Randolph Gaitskill playing
with Little Bit on a plot of grass beside the court-house.
Then Mustard woke up!</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dis here is my Gawd-given chance to git my
rabbit-foot,” was the idea which exploded in his
brain, and he started for the Gaitskill home with all
the speed in his body.</p>
<div>
  <a id='Page_68'></a>
  <h3 class='c010'>XII<br /> <br />THE HIGHEST BIDDER</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Attracted by the crowd, Org and Little Bit became
interested witnesses curious to know who
would finally acquire old Jinx. This was the first
auction Org had ever seen, and without an idea of
the financial obligations involved in the transaction,
he began to help the matter along.</p>

<p class='c005'>When it seemed that Jinx was going to be
knocked down to somebody, Org, at the solicitation
of the auctioneer, bid eight!</p>

<p class='c005'>“Eight dollars, eight, eight, eight!” the auctioneer
whooped, seizing the bid like a woodpecker
swoops upon a ripe June-bug. “Who’ll
make it nine?”</p>

<p class='c005'>It was a hot day. The perspiration streamed
down the face of the auctioneer and the old mule
stood with bowed head, panting for breath, utterly
oblivious to the crowd around him. The auctioneer
draped one arm over Jinx’s protruding
hip-bone, hanging there for support, while he
chanted:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Nine, nine, nine—somebody make it nine!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why don’t you do what that gentleman asks
you?” Org inquired of Little Bit. “He asks you
to make it nine—why don’t you do it?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Nine dollars!” Little Bit exclaimed in a frightened
tone.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_69'></a>“Ten!” Orren Randolph Gaitskill called.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ten, I’m bid; ten, I’m bid—somebody’s either
drunk or crazy, by jacks! Ten, I’m bid—who’ll
play damphool and make it ’leven?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“’Leben!” Little Bit chimed.</p>

<p class='c005'>The auctioneer jerked off his big wool hat,
slapped it against the bony side of the mule till it
popped like a pistol and howled:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Wake up, Jinx! You old varmint—you are
surrounded by friends! Wake up and show your
manners!”</p>

<p class='c005'>The mule raised his head, shut one eye with an
absurdly sleepy wink, dropped one big leathery
ear forward, and let his head sag down until his
nose almost touched his knee.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Twelve dollars!”</p>

<p class='c005'>This was more than the auctioneer could endure.
He must ascertain the source of these rival bids.
A shout of laughter rose from the crowd of men
which shook the windows in the stores, as the auctioneer
stooped and looked between the men and
his red-rimmed eyes rested upon two boys, one
white, one black!</p>

<p class='c005'>“Who bid that twelve dollars?” he snapped,
glaring at the boys.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Me,” Org confessed.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You want to buy this old mule?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Er—yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Have you got twelve dollars to pay for it?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_70'></a>“Where’s that money—show it to me!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It’s up in Gince’s room,” Org said without
explaining who Gince was. “I’ll have to go after it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Go! Hurry!” the auctioneer snapped, wiping
the perspiration from his face. “What sort of
business man are you, leaving your pocketbook
lying around? Here, you, Little Bit! Hold old
Jinx till this boy comes back!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Mustard lost no time in getting to Gaitskill’s
home, but the resolution which had given speed
to his feet oozed away when he arrived, and left
him a timorous negro, hesitant, ignorant of how
to proceed further to secure the object he had come
after. Mustard had no practical experience in this
sort of work to guide him now. He realized dimly
that it was not becoming that the trusted overseer
of a great plantation should sneak into his employer’s
home and take something from it, even
though the thing he took really belonged to him.
But he knew that this was the only way he could
get the luck-charm without letting Marse Tom
know.</p>

<p class='c005'>He reconnoitered and assured himself that no
one was in the house. He walked through the
kitchen, entered the back hall, and climbed cautiously
up the back steps. Walking quietly, he
went through the upper hall toward the front and
stood at last looking into the dainty, exquisite
room of the girl in the home.</p>

<p class='c005'>It took him a long time to muster the courage to
<a id='Page_71'></a>go in. It was a pretty room, with ferns and photographs
and flowered cretonne, an old rosewood bed
of exquisite beauty of design, beside it a small
electric lamp with a rose-colored shade. Two
windows, shaded by loosely hanging rose-colored
silk, a rosewood writing-desk. Mustard saw all
this unconsciously. His eyes were set upon the
rosewood dressing-table against the wall between
the two windows. On the table lay a gold mesh
purse; beside the purse were three rings, whose
gems could have bought Mustard a barrel full of
rabbit-feet!</p>

<p class='c005'>Of all the treasures in that room, Mustard
wanted the least valuable, measured by pecuniary
standards. If he had been dying of starvation, he
would not have stepped within that room to lay
a thievish hand upon a single object. But he had
to have that rabbit-foot!</p>

<p class='c005'>One step at a time, moving with fear and trembling,
he started toward the dressing-table. Frightened,
he backed out into the hall again; venturing
once more, he got almost to the table, then backed
again. He stepped to the far end of the hall and
looked anxiously down the back steps, fearful that
someone might have entered the kitchen. Then
he returned to the room, ventured, backed out,
moved forward, moved sidewise, hesitated, side-stepped,
moved forward slowly and at last laid
his black, square-shaped, labor-hardened hand
upon the beautiful white scarf upon the dresser!</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_72'></a>One of Orren Randolph Gaitskill’s favorite games
was to play “Indian.” This consisted in sneaking
about the house in absolute silence, dodging behind
the doors, crawling under the beds and
couches and tables if he heard anyone approaching
and when a suitable opportunity presented
itself, he would jump out upon some member of
the household with a blood-curdling yell!</p>

<p class='c005'>Org was playing Indian now for a purpose. He
was by no means sure that his sister would approve
his purchasing a mule for twelve dollars even with
his own money, and he planned to slip up to her
room and get his money out of his own purse in her
dressing-table drawer without her knowledge.</p>

<p class='c005'>He noiselessly opened the front door and entered
the reception room. As he sneaked up the
steps, his eyes came level with the floor of the hallway
above, he saw Mustard Prophet, backing and
filling, giving a ridiculous illustration of a steamboat
trying to make a difficult landing.</p>

<p class='c005'>Great is the imagination of boyhood!</p>

<p class='c005'>Org caught this thing in an instant: Here he
was, a wild and savage Indian slipping up upon a
steamboat of pioneers while the boat was trying
to land upon the banks of the mighty Mississippi.
Mustard Prophet, backing and filling, moving up
and moving back, was the steamboat!</p>

<p class='c005'>Mustard’s negro wife went into Miss Virginia’s
room every day to straighten up. Mustard helped
Hopey around the house all the time. The fact
<a id='Page_73'></a>that Mustard was in the house, or even in his
sister’s room, made no difference to the boy. That
part of it was all right.</p>

<p class='c005'>Orren was determined that Mustard should not
see him. He lay down flat upon the stair-steps
and crawled with the greatest caution toward the
top.</p>

<p class='c005'>Just as the steamboat navigated the dangerous
waters of Miss Gaitskill’s room and threw out a
line on the dressing-table, the Indian peeped
around the door-jamb!</p>

<p class='c005'>It is better to abandon the rhetorical and imaginative
now; it is too easy to forget which is who,
and get the Indian and the steamboat mixed.</p>

<p class='c005'>What Org saw as he peeped around the door was
Mustard Prophet, his nervous black hand resting
upon the dressing-table. Slowly Org raised himself
to his feet and took a big breath and jumped.</p>

<p class='c005'>There was a loud whoop, which Org imagined
was the equivalent to a blood-curdling yell!</p>

<p class='c005'>It curdled Mustard Prophet, all right!</p>

<p class='c005'>The negro was absolutely petrified! He stood
like a statue carved of ebony, apparently nothing
alive about him except the eyes, which got bigger
and burned with fires of terror. Fright sometimes
paralyzes temporarily; nothing moves, even the
mind stands still. The victim helpless, disaster
swoops down like an eagle upon its prey.</p>

<p class='c005'>Orren was disappointed.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why didn’t you jump when I hollered?” he
<a id='Page_74'></a>exclaimed in an aggrieved tone. “I’m playing
Indian.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Orren was completely blind to the negro’s pitiful
fright. It was fully a minute before Mustard
could utter a word. The vital forces had ceased,
and they started slowly as when a street-car grips
the vital force of the cable and gets going.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dat yell wus so disturbin’ dat I felt—er—sorter
disturbed, Marse Org,” he sighed weakly,
walking toward the hall and resting his hand upon
the door-jamb. “I wus plum’ putrified wid bein’
so skeart!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You don’t act like it,” Org snorted. “The
next time I yell like that, you jump!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I will, Marse Org, I shore will!” Mustard
promised him fervently. “I got to hurry down
to de kitchen now. Goo-good-by!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Org jerked open the drawer of the dressing-table,
flirted a green-plush box which contained a rabbit-foot
out of his way, picked up his own little
purse and extracted twelve dollars.</p>

<p class='c005'>Slamming the drawer shut, he went racing back
to the court-house to pay for his mule.</p>
<h3 class='c010'>XIII<br /> <br />THE HIRELINGS</h3>

<p class='c011'>When Org stopped in front of the court-house
and placed the twelve dollars in the auctioneer’s
<a id='Page_75'></a>sweating, dirt-begrimed palm, that functionary
bellowed:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Twelve, I’m bid, once! Twelve, I’m bid, twice!
Twelve, I’m bid, three times, and sold! Sold to
this boy for twelve dollars! Go git your mule,
son!”</p>

<p class='c005'>The auctioneer sought a convenient place to
quench a consuming thirst. Old Jinx stood in the
middle of the street, his eyes closed, his big, loose
ears hanging down like a couple of banana-leaves
that had broken and were flapping down around
the stalk of the plant. Org caught hold of one big
ear and spoke down into its fuzzy, dusty depth,
exactly as a man speaks into the mouth-piece of a
telephone:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Hello, hello! Wake up!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Little Bit placed the end of a small leading-rope
into Org’s hands and announced:</p>

<p class='c005'>“You done bought a mule, Marse Org. Whut
you gwine do wid him?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What?” Org asked.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You cain’t leave dis here mule standin’ still an’
blockin’ up de street,” Little Bit explained.
“Dey’ll arrest dis mule an’ put him in de holdover
like dey does all de stray cows, an’ it’ll cost you
five dollars to git him out.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I haven’t got any five dollars,” Org announced.
“That man took all the money I had.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I reckin we better lead him somewheres,”
Little Bit laughed.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_76'></a>“Help me up on him,” Org commanded. “I
want to ride him now.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You ain’t got no bridle,” Little Bit demurred.
“Dat mule ain’t know whar you want him to go
’thout no bridle onless you kin gee-haw him, an’
you ain’t know nothin’ about ploughin’. An’
he’ll shore take you back whar he came from
ef you ain’t guide him somewhar else.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I guess we better go ahead of him and show
him the way,” Org proposed. Then gazing at the
closed eyes, he said: “I guess we better take him
home and let him take a nap; he looks awful
sleepy to me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“He’s like a nigger,” Little Bit snickered. “A
mule an’ a nigger kin sleep standin’ up an’
walkin’!”</p>

<p class='c005'>At the foot of the hill near the Gaitskill home,
Jinx uttered a loud groan and sank down upon his
side, slapping the earth with a jolt that shook the
ground under their feet.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dar now, he shore come down wid a looseness
like he’s fixin’ to die,” Little Bit exclaimed. “Ef
he dies here in dis town, it’ll cost you fo’ dollars
to hab him hauled away.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I haven’t got four dollars,” Org replied, and
then ran down the street, waving his arms at an
automobile.</p>

<p class='c005'>The machine stopped and Dr. Moseley leaned
out and listened:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Doctor, I know you ain’t a mule physician,
<a id='Page_77'></a>but I just bought a big mule and he’s took sick
and if he dies it’ll cost a lot of money to have him
hauled off. I ain’t got the money to have him
hauled away, and so you must come and keep
him from dying.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Got any money to pay my doctor’s bill?” the
physician asked.</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, sir.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Got any money to pay for medicine to cure
your mule?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, sir.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Charity patient, by jacks!” the physician
grinned.</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, sir,” Org protested. “Me and my mule
will pay. Whenever your automobile breaks
down, I’ll let you ride my mule!”</p>

<p class='c005'>No offer could be fairer, so Org swung up on the
foot-board and rode with the obliging physician
to the sick-bed of the mule. That able physician
had once been all-boy himself, and he understood.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Bless my soul, if it ain’t Jinx!” he laughed as
he drew near the prostrate animal. After a moment’s
examination he added: “That mule is
hungry, boys. Feed him! Feed him quick!
Feed him high! Repeat the dose three times a
day before each meal!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Laughing, he turned his automobile and went
off.</p>

<p class='c005'>Two hours passed while the boys were getting
feed and watching Jinx eat. They did not mind
<a id='Page_78'></a>waiting. They sat on the curb in great contentment,
discussing their purchase and planning for
the future. Several men and women passed and
stopped to chat with the boys, attracted by the
novelty of a mule lying on the side of a road attended
by two small boys. Without exception
they recognized Jinx, for that mule was an established
institution in Tickfall.</p>

<p class='c005'>When Jinx got up the hill to the Gaitskill home
he appeared very familiar with the place. In
fact, he had been one of the Gaitskill mules several
times in his varied career, and had found few other
places where he had been as well treated.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I guess we better let him stay in the front
yard to-night, Little Bit,” Org said as he opened
the gate and turned the animal in upon the Gaitskill
lawn. “He’s too feeble to walk back as far
as the stable, and I haven’t got any more time to
fool with this mule. All our family are going to
eat at Captain Kerley Kerlerac’s home to-night.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The boys walked back together, separating at
the court-house, and Little Bit went to the Hen-Scratch
saloon.</p>

<p class='c005'>He found Skeeter Butts in charge—told the
story of Jinx, incidentally remarking that the
whole Gaitskill family had gone to Kerlerac’s to
eat dinner with his “boss.”</p>

<p class='c005'>This last information pleased Skeeter Butts
very much. He went out in the rear of the saloon
to be by himself and think it over.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_79'></a>“Dat rabbit-foot is as good as got back already.
I knows all about Marse Tom’s house. I done
wucked in dat house so much dat I could walk
eve’ywhar in it wid my eyes shut.”</p>

<p class='c005'>About that time Hopey Prophet informed
Dazzle Zenor of the absence of the Gaitskill family
that evening. She knew the house, knew the
people, and while she had not quite the liberty of
an old family retainer, she fixed her plans to take
this opportunity to raid the house.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ll git dat foot certain,” she answered.</p>

<p class='c005'>Skeeter waited impatiently until nine o’clock,
then lighted a cigarette and sauntered out of the
saloon. Under ordinary circumstances he would
have entered the Gaitskill house from the rear.
But, knowing that no one was at home, he came
to the front porch and entered the front door.
Once inside the house, he became extremely cautious.
No use making a noise, even if there was
no one to hear except himself.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was very dark in the reception room, and
while Skeeter was familiar with the house, and was
sure that he was alone in it, he did not care to disarrange
any furniture, and still less did he wish to
fall over something and break it. He crept silently
up the stairs and paused within a few feet of the
room he intended to enter.</p>

<p class='c005'>He heard a sound. Listening for a moment, he
decided that someone was moving in the house,
and that he had better not try to secure the rabbit-foot
<a id='Page_80'></a>that night. His close-clipped hair stood up on
his head like pig bristles as he began to retreat, and
he lost no time in beating his way back to the hall
below. He started to open the front door and escape
that way, but on the second thought he decided
it would be safer to go out through the kitchen.</p>

<p class='c005'>As he passed into the back hall he heard some
one coming down the steps of the back stairs. He
crouched in a corner, waiting for the person to
descend. Whoever it was, passed within a few
feet of him, crossed the kitchen, and went out of
the door. Skeeter noiselessly followed.</p>

<p class='c005'>Once safely outside the house a senseless
panic struck him, and he shot around the corner
toward the front at full speed. On the walk in
front of the house he collided with a terrible force
with something, the impact jarring every bone in
his body, and for a moment knocking him breathless,
senseless. The second party in the collision,
with a whistling expiration of breath sank limply
against Skeeter Butts. He thrust out his arms
and embraced a woman!</p>

<p class='c005'>Skeeter was fond of the lady folks, and was
usually chivalrous. But on this occasion he
“dropped” the lady right there; cut her dead, so
to speak. And started across the lawn at a speed
never before attained by his pedal extremities.</p>

<p class='c005'>Skeeter traveled crawfish fashion; he went forward,
but he looked back. He turned to see where
he was going, and there suddenly loomed before
<a id='Page_81'></a>him a big, black object which looked to him as
large as a house.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was Jinx, lying on the ground.</p>

<p class='c005'>Skeeter hit the front end of Jinx first and fell
sprawlingly forward, and his arms and legs, outspread,
were spraddled across Jinx’s bony back.
The startled mule, aroused from his slumber, bellowed
like a cow and began to get up, rising in bony
sections, like a folding ladder.</p>

<p class='c005'>For a moment Skeeter hung on to a few protruding
bones, then he emitted a little whimpering
sigh, slided off the bony sides of the ever-rising
mountain, and lay flat upon the ground. The
second collision had knocked him out.</p>

<p class='c005'>Skeeter did not lose consciousness. He just
lost breath. It was a long time before he rallied
sufficiently to sit up, and when he did he heard a
woman weeping softly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Who is dat onwindin’ dat bawl?” Skeeter
inquired softly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dis here is me,” the woman answered, which
was enough for Skeeter, for he knew that voice.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Whut wus you doin’ in dat house, Dazzle?”
Skeeter asked, when he found her in the dark, sitting
on the bottom step of the porch.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I wus tryin’ to git dat rabbit-foot,” she said
simply.</p>

<p class='c005'>“How come you know about dat foot?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Hopey tole me. I wants de money Mustard
is put up to git it back.”</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_82'></a>“I wants dem dollars, too,” Skeeter laughed.
“Less go in togedder an’ ’vide up de money even-Stephen.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I takes you on,” Dazzle said, finding comfort
in her grief.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not no more to-night,” Skeeter said. “Dar’s
a mule runnin’ loose in dis yard as big as a battleship.
I butted him like a torpedo.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Whut happened?” Dazzle asked.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I wus Jinxed,” Skeeter said simply. “Less go
home.”</p>
<h3 class='c010'>XIV<br /> <br />THE ALLIGATOR</h3>

<p class='c011'>Jinx became the greatest plaything that Org and
Little Bit possessed. He could not fatten, but
under the care and treatment he received he acquired
a little more interest in life, and showed
quite a fondness for his youthful owner.</p>

<p class='c005'>Gaitskill laughed, and decided that the mule
would keep Org out of mischief, which would
justify the cost of its keep. Tickfall smiled at the
sight of a little boy sitting on a big saddle while
a diminutive black boy sat behind him, proud of
his position and waving a greeting to all his black
friends as he passed. Org and Little Bit would
not have swapped Jinx for an automobile.</p>

<p class='c005'>“A automobile gits out of fix,” Little Bit said
as they discussed this one day. “When she stops
<a id='Page_83'></a>nothin’ kin make her go. Ef somepin gits de
matter wid it, nobody knows whut ails her.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But this mule is different,” Org said proudly.
“I like something that wags its tail.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dis hay-burner suits me,” Little Bit agreed.</p>

<p class='c005'>They found to their delight that Jinx was
thoroughly familiar with that great jungle called
the Little Moccasin Swamp. The boys could ride
out to that swamp upon Jinx and turn into any
path which led into the jungle. The mule would
carry them for miles along the winding animal
trails, and then to their surprise they would find
themselves in the highway again. They explored
recesses in that swamp which they could never
have reached without the mule, and they were
never uneasy about losing their way.</p>

<p class='c005'>They found great pools of water where large
fish swam that were easily visible to the eye, and
apparently unafraid. They found great sinks of
vegetation where ugly snakes crawled, and they
learned that Jinx could smell a snake as far as the
eye could see, and that he had no desire to get
near enough to be bitten. They saw immense
turtles sunning themselves upon the logs and
stumps. They found droves of wild pigs, extremely
dangerous to man when he was standing
upon his two feet, but harmless when a four-footed
animal carried them upon his back.</p>

<p class='c005'>Hence arose this matter of debate between
them: Can a wild hog count? If he cannot, how
<a id='Page_84'></a>does he know the difference between two legs and
four legs?</p>

<p class='c005'>They found an eagle’s nest, came too near, and
were followed for miles by a screaming bird which
swooped down upon them, fanned her immense
wings within an inch of their hats, and snapped her
vicious beak in their faces with a noise like the snip
of immense shears. Once they saw a panther
crouched upon a live-oak limb, his eyes glowing in
the jungle shadows like living rubies; the animal
screamed at them—the only thing which ever extracted
a burst of speed from Jinx. They were
followed for miles as they went out of that
swamp by that screaming, snarling, hissing, spitting
cat.</p>

<p class='c005'>Once Little Bit turned around and made a noise
like an exploding pop-bottle, a method which he
had found efficacious in frightening domestic cats
away. The vocal answer to Little Bit’s elocutionary
effort was so terrifying that Jinx nearly
jumped out of his skin.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then one day, on the edge of a little clearing,
they found a six-foot alligator asleep in the sun.</p>

<p class='c005'>They dismounted and walked closer. The
alligator slept on.</p>

<p class='c005'>“How close can we get to this thing before he
wakes up, Little Bit?” Org asked.</p>

<p class='c005'>“He’s awake right now,” Little Bit told him.
“He pretends like he’s so sleepy he’s mighty nigh
dead, but he knows we is here all right. But he
<a id='Page_85'></a>won’t move till you gits right on him, close enough
to tech him wid yo’ hand.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What’ll he do then?” Org wanted to know.</p>

<p class='c005'>“He’ll slap his tail aroun’ and knock yo’ foots
out from under you an’ bite yo’ leg plum’ off,”
Little Bit informed him. “He’s layin’ dar now
waitin’ fer a wild pig to come rootin’ aroun’ him
like wild pigs does aroun’ logs. Den he’ll slap ’em
wid his tail an’ bite ’em in two.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The boys backed away, climbed upon the trunk
of a fallen tree, and looked across the underbrush
at the alligator. He was as still as an old rusty
stove-pipe, which he somewhat resembled.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Less take that rope off our saddle and rope
him,” Org suggested. “They rope everything in
California, cattle and everything.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Who’s gwine put dat rope aroun’ dat alligator?”
Little Bit asked.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You can do that,” Org replied as he untied the
rope from the saddle.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Mebbe I kin, but I ain’t gwine to,” Little Bit
asserted, climbing up on the back of the mule.
“Little Bit don’t choose but a little bit of alligator
in his’n. Dis mule don’t hanker fer none.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“All right, ’fraid-cat,” Org taunted. “You
hold the mule, and I’ll throw the rope.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Like most boys who had lived in the West, Org
had often played with a rope, looping it and throwing
it in imitation of the cowmen. He climbed
upon a trunk of a fallen tree about thirty feet from
<a id='Page_86'></a>the quiescent alligator, coiled the rope, and threw
it with wonderful luck. The coil straightened,
and the open loop fell right in front of the
alligator.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the less remote sections the alligator is fearful,
for it has learned the menace of man. But
this one had possibly never seen a human being
before. When the rope fell it moved forward a few
feet and became quiet again. Org gave the rope a
quick jerk, and the loop caught under one of the
alligator’s front feet and over his head. Org was
standing by a limb upon the fallen tree, bracing
himself to keep his balance. Quickly he twisted
his end of the rope around the limb and tied it.</p>

<p class='c005'>The creature was still unaware that it was captive.
Org threw a few branches from the tree in
its direction, and it crawled slowly forward a few
feet. At last it came to the end of the rope.</p>

<p class='c005'>A hoarse, coughlike bark rang through the
forest, and instantly that six-foot alligator was a
snarling fury as it entered into combat with its
bonds. For ten minutes the two frightened boys
beheld the most terrifying spectacle they had ever
imagined. Org scuttled down from the treetrunk
and took refuge with Little Bit upon the
back of the mule, making ready for instant flight.</p>

<p class='c005'>Within a radius of that rope the alligator beat
down the marsh-grass as flat as if a road-rolling
machine had passed over it. He got into the low
underbrush and pounded it down, making a noise
<a id='Page_87'></a>like an express train with his powerful clawing
feet and his slapping tail. He roared and raised
himself almost upright on his tail, and clawed at
the rope with his front feet as a man would fight
with his hands, and snapped his great jaws together
like the slapping of two clapboards.</p>

<p class='c005'>But he could never succeed in getting the rope
between his teeth, for the reason that he could not
turn his head or lower his chin. Finally, in an
awful burst of fury, he threw himself backward,
rolled over and over, slapping, thrashing, clawing,
snarling, uttering awful coughlike barks to which
a thousand echoes in the forest responded in kind.
The boys wondered at the creature’s catlike agility,
shuddered at the concentrated venomous fury of
the battle, quivered with awe at the agonizing,
snarling vociferation emitted from between those
terrible, gnashing, snapping teeth.</p>

<p class='c005'>Yet the very configuration of the woods fought
for the boys. The rope was constantly taut, for
the reason that it could hardly be moved without
becoming entangled with roots and cypress knees
and the tough underbrush and the clinging, almost
unbreakable vines called bamboo. The struggle
against these obstacles slowly exhausted the alligator’s
strength.</p>

<p class='c005'>At last he sank down and remained quiet.</p>

<p class='c005'>After a while the boys mustered their courage
and crept forward to see. They found their captive
had twisted the rope around the cypress knees
<a id='Page_88'></a>and projecting roots until he was tied to the ground
and helpless. His eyes were not sleepy now. They
glowed with baleful flames, ugly, piglike, with
glints of green in their fires of fury. The big
mouth gaped wide when he saw the boys, and the
jaws snapped with frightful force.</p>

<p class='c005'>After a consultation, the two boys ran across
the clearing to a switch-cane jungle and cut two
long cane poles. Returning with these, they began
to prod and torment the alligator, thrusting the
poles into his mouth when he opened it; and when
he no longer would let them look at his tongue,
they still pursued their medical examination by
punching him in every place where they thought
he might have a particularly tender spot.</p>

<p class='c005'>This roused him to another performance, a fury
of struggle in which he fought and roared and
barked and clawed at the rope, and thrashed with
his tail, and chased the two boys up a tree until his
activities abated.</p>

<p class='c005'>All day long they tormented the alligator, exhausting
every resource in their efforts to get him,
as they expressed it, “to cut up some more.” But
after five or six hours there was no more fight in him.</p>

<p class='c005'>When the alligator showed plainly that he had
made positively his last appearance as an entertainer,
the boys decided it was time to start for
home.</p>

<p class='c005'>“How we gwine git our rope back?” Little Bit
asked.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_89'></a>“Let that old sucker keep his old rope. I don’t
want it,” Org said, wiping the sweat from his face
on the sleeve of his shirt and sitting down in utter
weariness.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Marse Tom will bust us ef we leaves dat rope
out in dese here woods,” Little Bit warned him.
“Ropes comes high in de store ef you got to pay
fer ’em.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ll tell Uncle Tom where it is, and let him come
after it when he wants it,” Org replied.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You better not let dat white man know we been
out here monkeyin’ wid a alligator,” Little Bit
said. “He’ll sell our mule an’ put me in jail an’
flay de hide offen you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That’s so,” Org agreed. “Well, the old alligator
is nearly dead. Let’s tie our end of the rope to
the saddle and make old Jinx drag the alligator up
to the house. Then when he dies we can get the
rope off him.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Little Bit agreed to this, and it was not hard to
do. They had whipped the alligator until there
was no more fight in him, and wearied him until
there was not more strength to fight. Their hardest
work was untwisting the rope, for as they got
nearer to the alligator they had to pry the rope
from around the roots and snags with a pole. They
never got the courage to get close to those jaws
which had snapped at them so terribly.</p>

<p class='c005'>Jinx did not object to a little light hauling when
a white boy walked on one side and a black boy on
<a id='Page_90'></a>the other, acting as escort of honor. The alligator
was easily dragged over the marsh-grass and
along the animal trails toward the town. Although
dragged for over three miles, he at no time showed
resistance or attempted to “cut up.”</p>

<p class='c005'>In the rear of the Gaitskill stables there was a
large pig-pen, to which admittance was gained by
a gate. Org led the mule in such a way that the
alligator faced the gate. Then he led the mule
around to the other side of the pen, led him forward,
and thus dragged the alligator through the
open gate.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then the boys took a rake, hung one of the teeth
through the loop in the rope, and by considerable
juggling they managed to make the loop loose and
large.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Now, if he kicks around any before he dies,
he’ll walk out of that rope,” Org announced.
“Then we won’t have to say anything about it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dat big old animile ain’t gwine die,” Little
Bit chuckled. “Us ain’t hurt him none, an’ by
dis time to-morrer he’ll be ready to fix fer anodder
fight.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’m through fighting alligators,” Org said
wearily. “I never was as hungry and tired in my
life. But we’ll keep this old sucker in his pen and
make him our pet alligator.”</p>
<div>
  <a id='Page_91'></a>
  <h3 class='c010'>XV<br /> <br />BLASTING POWDER</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Org and Little Bit loved to play in an old storehouse
situated in the corner of the yard in the rear
of Gaitskill’s home. There was a reason. Both
loved sweets, and in that house was where Colonel
Gaitskill stored his famous ribbon-cane sirup.</p>

<p class='c005'>This sweet, so famous in the State, is not marketable.
When once it is put in a barrel or other
container, it cannot be moved or it will turn to sugar.
Even with the greatest care, it is pretty sure
to turn sugary before it is all used up. The sugar
forms first a hard crust around the inside of the
barrel and around the spigot from which it is
drawn. Sometimes you can turn that spigot on
full and the stream will be a tiny thread of liquid
sweetness which flows with exasperating slowness.
A moment later the sugary obstruction may break
from around the spigot, and after that, the flood!</p>

<p class='c005'>Doubtless Shakespeare had such a catastrophe
in mind when he wrote of</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The taste of sweetness, whereof a little</div>
      <div class='line'>More than a little is by much too much.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Half a dozen times a day Org and Little Bit
slipped into this storeroom, turned on the spigot
of the sirup barrel, caught the tiny stream of sweetness
in the palms of their hands, and lapped it out
with their tongues.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_92'></a>They were at that enjoyable diversion now.</p>

<p class='c005'>Suddenly there was a loud whoop of fright from
the direction of the orchard where Mustard
Prophet had gone to gather some figs for lunch.
The boys ran to the door and looked out. They
saw Mustard climb down from a rickety step-ladder,
fold that ladder together and hurl it in the
direction of some object. Then he came out of
that orchard, stepping high like a turkey wading
through mud, looking constantly behind him, and
making as many different noises with his mouth as
a whole brass band.</p>

<p class='c005'>Hopey, thinking he had been bitten by a snake,
met him half-way to the house.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Whut ails you, Mustard?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c005'>“My Gawd, Hopey!” he panted. “Dar’s a alligator
out in dat orchard fawty feet long! I seen it!”</p>

<p class='c005'>The noise Mustard made had brought all the
members of the family out to see what the trouble
was. When he told them of seeing the alligator,
Org said nothing, and the others of the household
were skeptical and laughed at him.</p>

<p class='c005'>“How do you know you saw an alligator?”
Colonel Gaitskill asked.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I throwed a step-ladder at it, Marse Tom,”
Mustard wailed. “It wus longer dan de ladder.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Come back to the orchard and show me,”
Gaitskill ordered.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Naw, suh!” Mustard whooped. “Go look
fer yo’se’f, boss. Dis nigger is done seen aplenty!”</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_93'></a>“Whut wus he doin’ in dat orchard?” Hopey
howled.</p>

<p class='c005'>“He wus aimin’ to climb dat step-ladder an’
bite my leg off when I seen him,” Mustard shuddered.
“I gib him de ladder an’ tole him he could
take my place!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Don’t make so much noise, Mustard,” Gaitskill
commanded, as he turned away and entered
the house. Nobody credited Mustard’s story,
except Org and Little Bit, and they slipped away
as soon as they could to see if their alligator was
still in captivity.</p>

<p class='c005'>They found that he had escaped, and a broad
trail led across the dust of the pig-lot toward the
orchard. The alligator had crawled through a
hole. The boys promptly decided not to enter
the orchard for any purpose whatsoever. Thinking
further, they decided they had better absent
themselves from home for the day, for that alligator
might do all sorts of sensational stunts, and
they had seen enough of his performances the
day before.</p>

<p class='c005'>Besides, Colonel Gaitskill might want to know
how the creature got on the premises, and Org
had found that the best way to avoid answering
questions was to be where questions could not be
addressed to him.</p>

<p class='c005'>At that moment there came to the ears of the
two boys a dull explosion. They turned their
faces in the direction of the sound and left home.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_94'></a>It is a pity that they did not first return to the
storehouse and turn off the spigot of the molasses
barrel. But they did not. That sirup ran two
days and one night!</p>

<p class='c005'>One of the annoyances of agriculture in Louisiana
is stumps. Whenever a farmer undertakes to
blast the stumps out of the ground with dynamite
or powder, he is sure to have a crowd of small boys
to watch him. Org had been on the trail of the
dynamiters for a number of days. Whenever
they heard an explosion, they knew that some
farmer was having a celebration of fireworks and
profanity, and they hurried to the spot, guided by
the explosive noises.</p>

<p class='c005'>By being around, they had surreptitiously acquired
a number of dynamite caps, also several
yards of fuse in various lengths. The sound they
had heard a few minutes before was over in the
direction of the Cooley bayou, and they went.</p>

<p class='c005'>What they saw when they got there, put the
fear of dynamite in their souls forever.</p>

<p class='c005'>There was a man who lived on the Cooley bayou
who walked on a wooden peg. He had attempted
to dynamite a fish-hole. He lighted the fuse of
the dynamite stick and walked toward the pool to
toss the stick into the water. His wooden peg
found a soft place in the earth, and he sank into the
mire up to his knees. He pitched forward on his
face, the stick of dynamite fell from his hand and
rolled just a few feet out of reach. The peg leg
<a id='Page_95'></a>was twisted under the sod and marsh-grass in
such a way that the unfortunate man could not
tear himself loose and escape from the stick of
dynamite.</p>

<p class='c005'>The explosion tore a hole in the ground in which
a large automobile might have been easily concealed,
and friends of the cripple found scraps of
him hanging in the trees a hundred yards away.</p>

<p class='c005'>Org and Little Bit arrived just in time to view
the effects of the tragedy, and came away with a
deep impression of the explosive power of dynamite.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dat stuff ain’t nothin’ fer us to fool wid, Marse
Org,” Little Bit said earnestly. “Jes’ look whut
dat little stick of dynamite done to dat big growed-up
man. Ef a wad of dynamite wus to bust close
to us, de white folks would hab to put on deir
readin’ specks to find de pieces, an’ dey’d tote us
bofe back to Tickfall on a shingle.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I know where plenty of blasting powder is,”
Org remarked. “Uncle Tom has a whole keg of
powder in his barn.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dat’s de stuff fer us to monkey wid,” Little
Bit agreed. “Us don’t hab to play wid so much
at one time dat we git blowed plum’ away.”</p>

<p class='c005'>They found the keg of powder and carried it
down to the little branch which ran around the
edge of the town. They were very careful as they
went around the stable, not to step on the alligator.
As they carried their powder away, they looked
<a id='Page_96'></a>back frequently to assure themselves that the
alligator was not in pursuit. When at last they
had reached the woods, they decided that it would
be a good idea to make several loud explosions to
scare the alligator and keep him from coming in
that direction.</p>

<p class='c005'>They spent several hours experimenting with
the powder, enjoying themselves in a variety of
dangerous ways without coming to any harm.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then Little Bit thought of a hollow log under
the wooden bridge that crossed this little branch
on the road to the Nigger-Heel plantation. The
log was about four feet long, the hollow through
the center being about four inches in diameter,
and extending nearly the entire length. To the
imagination of boys, this thing would be suggestive
of a cannon. When Little Bit showed the log to
Orren Gaitskill, that was the first thought in his
mind.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Let’s put some gunpowder in this log and
shoot her off,” he proposed. “It’s just like a
cannon.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Us ain’t got no fuse-hole,” Little Bit remarked.</p>

<p class='c005'>“We can go up to Uncle Tom’s and borrow a
auger and bore a fuse-hole,” Org replied. “I
know where an auger is.”</p>

<p class='c005'>They concealed their keg of powder under some
brush and spent an hour going after the tool, playing
along the road both coming and going. Then
they took turns in working, as they bored the hole.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_97'></a>“Less load her up now and shoot off, and that’ll
make an end of a perfect day,” Org remarked,
quoting a part of a song he had heard his sister
sing to Captain Kerlerac.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dis ole cannon is gwine use up all our powder,”
Little Bit declared, as he peeped up the hollow to
where the light of the fuse-hole showed.</p>

<p class='c005'>“We don’t care,” Org laughed. “This powder
don’t cost us nothing.”</p>

<p class='c005'>They placed their fuse properly, then emptied
the contents of the keg into the muzzle of the log
cannon. They rammed the charge home with a
number of old sacks which they had been thoughtful
enough to pick up in the barn and bring with
them when they went after the augur. Then they
added several hat-loads of leaves and grass which
they mixed with mud from the branch. After
that they charged the “cannon” to the very end
with great quantities of sod torn up from the edge
of the branch and rammed hard into the muzzle
with the blunt end of a big stick.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Now she’s ready to shoot. Who’s going to
light the fuse?” Org asked.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not me,” Little Bit said positively. “I’m jes’
a little fool nigger, an’ ain’t to be trusted wid no
important jobs.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ll light the fuse,” Org announced. “Go up
on the road and see if anybody is coming.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Little Bit ran up on the little frail wooden
bridge which was about twelve feet long, made a
<a id='Page_98'></a>survey, and announced that all was clear. Then
he ran far over in the woods.</p>

<p class='c005'>Org lighted the fuse and followed his black companion
at his best speed. When they reached
what they thought was a safe distance, they
paused and waited.</p>

<p class='c005'>The idea of the boys was that the powder
would simply shoot the mud out of the log,
just as a bullet is propelled from the muzzle
of a gun. But blasting powder is not a propulsive
force; it is something that rends and tears,
exerting as much pressure in one direction as in
another.</p>

<p class='c005'>Therefore the boys were very much surprised,
when they heard the explosion, to see the frail
wooden bridge which spanned the narrow branch
rise in the air, break into a number of pieces, and
scatter all over the place!</p>

<p class='c005'>The log cannon went to pieces also.</p>

<p class='c005'>The boys went somewhere else. They did not
run. They could easily have overtaken and
passed anybody that was merely running. They
just went away from there.</p>

<p class='c005'>When completely overcome by exhaustion, they
dropped down under a tree far away from the
scene of their exploit. When, after a long time,
they had somewhat recovered their composure and
their breath, they began to plan for the future,
when, as they thought, they would have to give
an account of themselves.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_99'></a>“What does the law do to a feller that busts up a
bridge, Little Bit?” Org asked.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ef he’s a nigger, like me, dey hangs him,”
Little Bit shuddered.</p>

<p class='c005'>“But if he’s white?” Org inquired.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dey shoots him,” Little Bit said.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then we won’t confess,” Org announced
decisively.</p>

<p class='c005'>They meditated awhile, and again Org asked a
question.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Did anybody see us with that kag of powder?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Nope. Us wus all alone.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then we needn’t say anything about that
kag,” Org declared. “Uncle Tom won’t miss it
for some time.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Don’t we say nothin’ about nothin’ bustin’?”
Little Bit asked.</p>

<p class='c005'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Look at all de scratches dat de briars cut on my
face when I wus runnin’ away,” Little Bit pointed.
“How’s I gwine esplain dese here scratches? I
got to say dat somepin’ busted on me, ain’t I?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, you fool!” Org exclaimed. “Don’t you
ever confess that anything busted on you or that
you were ever round any busting thing. Tell ’em
that you cut your face—er——”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You had better think up a powerful good lie,”
Little Bit quavered. “My mammy, she kin ketch
on powerful easy to tales.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Tell her that you cut your face—er—shaving!”
<a id='Page_100'></a>Org replied, uttering the last word with triumphant
emphasis.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dat shows you don’t know nothin’ about
niggers,” Little Bit scoffed. “Most niggers ain’t
got no hair on deir face an’ don’t never hab to shave.
A nigger whut kin grow a moustacher an’ whiskers—he’s
proud of hisse’f!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Aw, shucks,” Org said in disgust. “That
ruins our perfectly good excuse.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“My face don’t look like it’s been cut with a
razor,” Little Bit said obstinately. “It looks like
it’s been sawed acrost wid a lot of blackberry
briars, dat’s whut.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I know it does, but you’ve got to tell some
kind of tale to keep us from being found out,” Org
said impatiently.</p>

<p class='c005'>“We don’t hab to tell nothin’,” Little Bit sighed.
“Dat bridge will say a plum’ plenty. It’ll preach
a whole sermont.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Don’t you say nothing about that bridge,”
Org howled. “Keep your mouth shut.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“’Spose de white folks axes me?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Tell ’em you don’t know anything.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ll tell ’em dat,” Little Bit said doubtfully.
“But ain’t gwine bear down on dat very hard. Ef
a nigger tells too many lies, Gawd’ll kill him!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“If you don’t tell a few about that bridge the
white folks will kill you before God can get around
to you,” Org declared.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then there popped into Orren’s head, the final
<a id='Page_101'></a>recourse of all the guilty, the establishment of a
false alibi.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Come on,” he howled, springing to his feet.
“We’ll go back to town and prove to everybody
that we have not been in the woods at all to-day.
We’ll let ’em see us.”</p>
<h3 class='c010'>XVI<br /> <br />A PAIR OF FEET</h3>

<p class='c011'>Dazzle Zenor went to the Hen-Scratch saloon
and sent word to Skeeter that she must see him
right away. When he came out to the rear, she
lost no time in stating her business.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Hopey jes’ come to my place an’ tole me dat
dar ain’t no Gaitskills at home. Org an’ Little
Bit is goned to de woods; Marse Tom is down to
de bank, an’ ole miss an’ Miss Virginny is gone out
fer a automobile ride; Mustard Prophet is gone
out to de Nigger-Heel plantation, an’ is takin’
Hopey an’ Popsy Spout wid him to give ’em a
outin’. Now is yo’ time to git de rabbit-foot.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes’m,” Skeeter agreed. “Dis time am
choosen of de Lawd. Is you willin’ to he’p me?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Suttinly. I’s in on de reeward bill.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dis is de plan,” Skeeter said. “I walks up
to Marse Tom’s jes’ easylike, kinder moseyin’
along, an’ I sneaks in de back way an’ I sneaks out
de back way an’ I walks down de back side of de
<a id='Page_102'></a>hill an’ makes a roundance to de road at de front
of de bottom of de hill.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dat’s de properest way to do,” Dazzle said.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yo’ plan is dis,” Skeeter continued. “You
drives my little automobile an’ waits fer me at de
foot of de hill on de side of de road. You keeps
dat engyne runnin’ an’ you heads dat machine
to’rds out of town. We goes straight to de Nigger-Heel
an’ gits our money.”</p>

<p class='c005'>For half an hour Dazzle amused herself by riding
around the town. It was Saturday afternoon,
a great crowd of country negroes was in Tickfall,
and the girl showed her skill as a driver by seeing
how close she could shave to the tail of the farm-wagons
and the rear end of the mules and horses
and cattle that were on the street.</p>

<p class='c005'>At one corner there was a drove of mules waiting
to be sold at auction; a little farther up the
street there was a herd of bony cattle that had
been driven down from the hill farms to be sold;
at another point there was a flock of sheep lying
in the dust, panting with the heat. Around each
of these there stood dozens of negroes, inspecting
what was for sale whether they intended to buy
or not. Dazzle greeted all these friends from the
country, but firmly refused all requests for a ride,
for she was watching the time, and was determined
to be at the meeting-place when Skeeter arrived.</p>

<p class='c005'>Skeeter sauntered around the streets for a little
while, watching the auctioneer in his business and
<a id='Page_103'></a>admiring his line of talk. Then he slipped quietly
out of the crowded street and hurried to the home
of Colonel Tom Gaitskill.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was not difficult or dangerous to rob a house
with nobody at home. Satisfying himself by an
inspection, that he was really alone on the premises,
Skeeter entered through the kitchen, went
into the little back hall, climbed the back stairs,
and entered the room of Miss Virginia Gaitskill.
He opened the drawer in her dresser and took out
the green-plush box, being careful not to disarrange
anything in the drawer. He paused long
enough to open the box and assure himself that
the rabbit-foot was in it, then he placed the box
in the inner pocket of his coat and went out as
quietly as he had come.</p>

<p class='c005'>It had been so easy that he decided to go out
the front way and thus avoid the long detour
necessary if he went down the hill on the far side
and had to walk around to the road. He peeped
around the corner of the house in the front, and
dodged back in a hurry.</p>

<p class='c005'>He saw Org and Little Bit climbing over the
fence into the horse-lot. They looked tired, as if
they had run a long distance, and they looked
either excited or scared, as if something unusual
had happened; and they were in a hurry, for they
climbed the fence rather than take the time to
open and shut the gate.</p>

<p class='c005'>Skeeter’s short hair stood upon his cranium like
<a id='Page_104'></a>hog-bristles. Had Orren Randolph Gaitskill
found out in some way that he was trying to steal
the rabbit-foot? Could Little Bit have been
around the saloon and overheard the conversation
about the rabbit-foot between himself and Dazzle?
Were they coming to the house now to protect
this precious green-plush box from theft?</p>

<p class='c005'>“I reckin I’s gwine take de long roundance,”
Skeeter muttered in a panicky tone as he ran with
all his speed toward the rear of the house, keeping
the building between himself and the two boys,
and when he started down the hill, dodging from
bush to bush like a rabbit.</p>

<p class='c005'>But the boys had something on their minds besides
Skeeter Butts. On their long run from the
little branch where the bridge had been blown up,
Org had thought of something that would attract
the attention of the people in Tickfall and register
in their minds the fact that he and Little Bit were
in town.</p>

<p class='c005'>Org had ridden with his Uncle Tom in the automobile,
and had seen Colonel Gaitskill shut off the
power from the engine and coast down the hill from
his house to the town. This had given Org an idea
on which he had been working for several days.
Under a shed in the rear of the Gaitskill stable
there was an abandoned, worn-out buggy, without
any shafts. Org had tied a rope to each end
of the front axle near the front wheels, and had
found by experiment that he could guide the buggy
<a id='Page_105'></a>by pulling on the rope, just as if he were driving a
horse. Little Bit had pushed the buggy around
the smooth, level horse-lot and Org had been able
to guide it without difficulty.</p>

<p class='c005'>So now, confronting this emergency, he decided
that the best game he could play would be that of
coasting down the Gaitskill hill toward the town
in that old buggy. It would be plenty of fun of a
kind that would attract attention from those in
town.</p>

<p class='c005'>He instructed Little Bit what to do, and the two
boys pushed the buggy out of the horse-lot and
stopped it on the brow of the hill. Org climbed
into his buggy on the top of the hill just about the
time that Skeeter Butts seated himself in his automobile
beside Dazzle Zenor at the foot of the hill.</p>

<p class='c005'>The two started about the same time.</p>

<p class='c005'>Skeeter planned to go up the street about a
block, then turn to his right and go out the principal
street to the Nigger-Heel plantation.</p>

<p class='c005'>Org expected to stop at the foot of the hill, and
push his buggy back to the top and coast down
again.</p>

<p class='c005'>One thing that Org had overlooked was that his
Uncle Tom’s automobile had a brake. The buggy
lacked that very important accessory, and when
Little Bit pushed it off and climbed on behind, it
had not traveled one hundred feet until it was going
thirty miles an hour. Half-way down the hill
it was “doing fifty,” and at the foot of the hill it
<a id='Page_106'></a>was just a rattling horror of incredible speed with
momentum enough to carry it half a mile on a
level road.</p>

<p class='c005'>That Providence which looks out for fools,
drunken men, and children, gave the buggy just
the right turn at the right time to shoot it out
toward Main Street. Its momentum carried it
across the street like a rocket, sent it plunging
madly across the court-house lawn, hurled it into
the middle of a lot in the rear of the court-house
where the country people hitched their horses and
mules, and there it ended its sensational and spectacular
flight by colliding with a hitching-rack,
spilling out the two boys like peas are tossed from
a spoon, and tearing itself to pieces!</p>

<p class='c005'>The two youngsters sprang up unhurt and made
tracks away from there.</p>

<p class='c005'>One old mule had seen the buggy coming over
the court-house lawn with nothing to pull it and
nothing to push it. It did not look natural to
him; it made the same impression on him that
a pair of pants would make on you if you saw
the pants coming down the street with nobody in
them.</p>

<p class='c005'>That mule opened his great mouth and uttered a
trumpetlike bray just as the vehicle hung up on the
hitching-rack. Then mister mule broke his bridle
and went galloping up the street, looking back
and bawling with every jump.</p>

<p class='c005'>Every mule in the hitching-lot promptly broke
<a id='Page_107'></a>loose and went galloping after the first mule, also
looking back at the strange vehicle which had
come among them. All the horses followed, neighing
their fright, some pulling buggies and some
wagons; some with harness on, some with saddles,
and as they all went up the street together, every
horse and mule on both sides of the street broke
away and joined in the procession.</p>

<p class='c005'>Many of the animals did not know what it was
all about. But it is a fact that if one runaway
starts down a street, all the other horses and mules
will run with him. They believe in safety first.</p>

<p class='c005'>Two blocks away there was a herd of cattle
standing in the middle of the street being sold at
auction. They saw the cyclone coming and fled
before it. A block farther up the street a flock of
terrified sheep saw the cattle coming, and started
out ahead of the cows. A block farther on a drove
of hogs saw the sheep coming, and they also believed
in safety first, and decided to get there first,
so they led the procession.</p>

<p class='c005'>As the grunting, bleating, bellowing, braying,
nickering procession of animals swept forward, all
the country dogs which had followed their masters
into town from every point of the compass fell in
behind and became a mighty chorus of yelping,
barking canines, and their number was augmented
and their chorus strengthened by all the dogs
which Tickfall could contribute. And all the men,
women, and children, white and black, and all the
<a id='Page_108'></a>shades of color between, swept out of the stores
and offices and shops to see what the disturbance
was about, and these fell in behind and added their
multitudinous shoutings to the noise and excitement
which was like the ululation of wind and
wave during a great storm at sea.</p>

<p class='c005'>In an incredible time the principal street of
Tickfall was swept clean of all its live stock and of
all its men, but it was littered everywhere with
pieces of broken buggies, broken wagons, broken
harness, and a dust-cloud was settling upon that
vacated street as if Mother Nature was trying to
bury what was left out of her sight.</p>

<p class='c005'>Now for the luck which attends the escapades
of youth: every person on the street had looked
toward the teams which were running away, and
not back at what had originally caused their flight.
Those boys had careened over the court-house yard,
had come to smash in the middle of the hitching-lot,
and had got up and gone away from there
without being seen by a single person who identified
them as the source of all the trouble. As for
Colonel Gaitskill’s buggy, he never missed it, and
if he had, he could never have identified it among
the smashed and broken vehicles that were junked
in the hitching-lot after the animals broke loose.</p>

<p class='c005'>The farmers knew that if one mule runs away
every other mule follows; so the poor mule who
first saw the buggy and uttered his frightened bawl
was blamed for the whole catastrophe!</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_109'></a>As for Skeeter Butts and Dazzle Zenor, they
were about two blocks from the court-house when
they heard that first terrified bray behind them.
In a moment the braying and bawling and bleating
and squealing and barking and yelling increased
greatly.</p>

<p class='c005'>We have the best authority for the statement
that the wicked flee where no man pursueth.</p>

<p class='c005'>Skeeter and Dazzle decided that all the inhabitants
of Tickfall were after them for the theft of
the rabbit-foot!</p>

<p class='c005'>Skeeter took one look behind him at that cloud
of dust, caught hold of his spark lever and pulled
it down to the last notch, then slowly opened his
throttle until it could go no farther. The speed
of his flight broke all records in Louisiana for his
make of automobile.</p>

<p class='c005'>His eyes were upon the road just as far ahead
of him as he could see, for he knew that going at
his present speed it would take a long time to stop.
In less than a minute he was drawing near to the
bridge over the little branch where Org and Little
Bit had played with the “cannon” a short time
before to the complete wreckage of that frail
structure. Skeeter knew this bridge was too narrow
for him to cross at his present rate of progress,
and he began to slow up.</p>

<p class='c005'>Suddenly Dazzle uttered a terrified shriek and
pointed ahead—the bridge was gone!</p>

<p class='c005'>Skeeter shut off all the power, pressed with all
<a id='Page_110'></a>his strength upon the foot-brake, set his emergency
brake with all the muscle in his arm, came to the
very edge of the branch, going no faster than a boy
could push a wheelbarrow, and—rolled in!</p>

<p class='c005'>Dazzle Zenor foresaw what would happen and
jumped out. But Skeeter was behind the wheel and
could not move quick enough, and he went down
ten feet into the creek with his little machine.</p>

<p class='c005'>There was the crack of a broken spring, the explosion
of two blown-out tires, the rending, grinding
noise of torn fenders, and the terrified wailing
of a little barkeeper who had been bounced out
into the creek and who had his clothes wet and his
feelings hurt and nothing else!</p>

<p class='c005'>And even that wailing ceased when Skeeter
heard what was coming. Dazzle saw it coming
first. She could not get off the road because of
a barbed-wire fence on each side, so she hopped
down into the water of the branch beside Skeeter.
And there, crouched beside the bank of the creek,
they saw the strangest sight two people ever
witnessed.</p>

<p class='c005'>First, a herd of hogs came squealing to the
broken bridge, looked down at them, uttered a surprised
series of grunts, split into two parties and
ran down into the creek and over into the woods.
Next followed a flock of bleating sheep, and they
took a look at Skeeter and Dazzle, split into two
like the pigs had done, some going down on one
side, some on the other, and all of them scattering
<a id='Page_111'></a>in the woods. Then followed a herd of cattle,
then a lot of mules and horses, then a great multitude
of dogs, then excited men in automobiles,
then men, women, and children afoot!</p>

<p class='c005'>All of them without exception came to the very
edge of the branch where the bridge was broken,
looked down at Skeeter and Dazzle, expressed surprise
either by grunt or squeal or bellow or bray or
neigh or yell or laugh—then turned to one side and
went down into the branch and into the woods!</p>

<p class='c005'>By the time this unique procession had arrived
at one end of the broken bridge, a farm-wagon
drove up and stopped at the other end. The
wagon contained Mustard and Hopey Prophet
and Popsy Spout on their way to town from the
Nigger-Heel plantation. Popsy was asleep.</p>

<p class='c005'>About seven hundred people had assembled at
that spot, and nearly all the live stock in the Parish
was out in the woods!</p>

<p class='c005'>To Skeeter’s unbounded amazement he found
himself a wounded hero instead of a criminal and
a captured fugitive.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Did the stock run you down on the bridge,
Skeeter?” Sheriff Flournoy asked; and that gave
Skeeter his cue.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, suh. De bridge is been pretty rickety a
long time, an’ dem animiles piled up all aroun’ me
an’ we jes’ nachelly all went down.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“If you want to bring suit against this Parish
for injuries to yourself and damage to your automobile,
<a id='Page_112'></a>I’ll help you,” Colonel Gaitskill snapped.
“I’ve been telling that road commissioner to
repair this bridge for the last three years, and now
he’ll get what is coming to him, and we’ll make him
pay for his neglect of duty.”</p>

<p class='c005'>That word “damages” sounded good to Skeeter.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’s pretty bad hurt, Marse Tom,” he sighed,
when he saw a chance to collect money for his injuries.
“Bofe ankles is spraint an’ my back is
busted, an’ my neck feels kinder stretched and
loose, an’ my head——”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Tell all that to the trial jury,” Gaitskill
snapped. “You can ride back in the wagon with
Mustard Prophet—I think you had better go on
right now!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Mustard drove down into the woods and, crossing
the branch, came up on the other side of the
broken bridge to the road. It took four men to
help Skeeter in the wagon, so great were his injuries
after he heard that magic word—damages!</p>

<p class='c005'>The first place they passed on the way back was
the Shin Bone eating-house. Skeeter decided that
this was a good place to demonstrate how badly
hurt he was, and he could exhibit his disability in
the presence of many witnesses.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I cain’t trabbel a inch furder, brudders,” he
sighed. “I’s gittin’ weaker an’ weaker all de time.
You better drap me off here at de resteraw.”</p>

<p class='c005'>So Mustard picked him up from the bed of the
wagon, carried him bodily into the eating-house
<a id='Page_113'></a>and laid him out on one of the dining-tables.
Dazzle and Hopey and Popsy Spout followed them
in, and Shin Bone hurried to see what the trouble
was.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I think I’s fixin’ to die, Mustard,” Skeeter
wailed, thrusting his yellow hand into the inside
pocket of his coat. “So I passes dis little thing
over to you befo’ I j’ines de angel band dat toots de
horns aroun’ de golden throne.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The little thing was a green-plush box containing
a rabbit-foot.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dat reminds my mind, Mustard,” Shin Bone
exclaimed, as he beheld the box. “I got somepin
dat b’longs to you, too.”</p>

<p class='c005'>He went to his cash-drawer, opened it, and in an
apartment underneath he brought out his treasure
and handed it to Mustard.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was a green-plush box containing a rabbit-foot.</p>

<p class='c005'>Skeeter’s eyes nearly popped out of his head.
As for Mustard, he was so completely dumfounded
that he merely stared at the two green-plush boxes
in helpless wonder.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Whar did you git dis green-plush box, Skeeter?”
Mustard asked at last.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ask Dazzle,” Skeeter wailed. “She knows—you
know, too.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Whar you git yo’ green-plush box, Shin?” Mustard
asked next, in a tone of superstitious consternation.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_114'></a>“About three weeks ago, ole Popsy Spout went
out to yo’ house to spend de day. When he got
back, he come in here an’ et, an’ he lef’ dis green
box on de eatin’ table. He explavicated about it
a little bit an’ said it b’longed to you!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Mustard turned around with the righteous fury
of Michel the archangel contending with the devil
to “bring against him a railing accusation”—but,
alas, Popsy had taken a hint from Skeeter’s recumbent
attitude, and was stretched out upon a dining-table
sound asleep.</p>

<p class='c005'>The unexpected duplication of the rabbit-feet
and the two boxes had the effect of relieving
Skeeter’s pretended injuries to the extent that he
was able to travel a little farther.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Take me home, Mustard,” he wailed. “Lemme
die at home in my own little cabin whut Marse
John gib to me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Mustard quickly understood that what Skeeter
really wanted was to get to some place where he
could talk about the new complication in the matter
of luck charms. He lifted Skeeter in his arms
and carried him back to the wagon, leaving Popsy
asleep upon the table, and leaving Dazzle and
Hopey to find their own conveyance to their house
in their own feet.</p>

<p class='c005'>When Mustard and Skeeter had closed the door
upon their conference in Skeeter’s cabin, Mustard
laid the rabbit-foot on Skeeter’s knee.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You got to take it back, brudder,” he said
<a id='Page_115'></a>earnestly. “’Twon’t do fer us folks to steal Marse
Tom’s rabbit-foot. Us is got to ack hones’.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Mebbe so,” Skeeter said doubtfully. “But
fur’s I’m concerned, Marse Tom kin hop along
widout dis foot.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It cain’t be did, Skeeter. You got to take it
back.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I done been hurt in a automobile bust-up,”
Skeeter protested. “I ain’t able to git about. De
dorctor will come here in a little while an’ examinate
me fer cote-house damages on account my
many injuries.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I makes dis trade wid you,” Mustard replied.
“You’s got fifty dollars of my money dat you ain’t
earnt because you didn’t recover my lucky foot.
I’ll gib you dat fifty to tote dis foot back.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I got you,” Skeeter answered promptly.
“When do I tote her back?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“To-morrer night,” Mustard told him. “Marse
Tom is gibin’ a big dinner at his house an’ you kin
slip in de house while dey is eatin’.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ll do it,” Skeeter promised. “But dis is de
last thing I’s gwine do fer you as long as I live. No
more detecative stealin’ jobs fer me!”</p>
<h3 class='c010'>XVII<br /> <br />LUCK AND LOVE</h3>

<p class='c011'>The next day, being Sunday and a dull day,
Skeeter found it both convenient and comfortable
<a id='Page_116'></a>to remain in bed and pretend to be severely injured
by his automobile accident. He planned to
spend the day in bed, and slip out at night and
carry the rabbit-foot back to the dresser-drawer in
Miss Virginia’s room.</p>

<p class='c005'>But about ten o’clock the road commissioner
called upon Skeeter, expressed his great regret at
the automobile accident and told Skeeter he had
come to settle for the damage that had been done.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I don’t want any lawsuit, Skeeter. It takes a
lot of time, and it takes a lot of money which has
to be paid to the lawyers and the courts. We’ll
fix this up between ourselves.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dat suits me,” Skeeter told him.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ll have your automobile repaired, put in perfect
condition, painted and polished and fixed like
new. Besides that I’ll give you one hundred
dollars.”</p>

<p class='c005'>With these words, he laid the money out on his
knee, one hundred dollars in one-dollar bills.</p>

<p class='c005'>Skeeter sat up, reached for the money, and
thrust it under his pillow on the bed.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Whar do I sign?” he grinned.</p>

<p class='c005'>The smiling commissioner indicated the dotted
line, Skeeter inscribed his name with a flourish,
and before that gentleman was out of the yard
Skeeter was kicking off the bed covers, preparing
to dress and go out.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dis here is my lucky day,” he announced to
his immortal soul.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_117'></a>About this time, Orren Randolph Gaitskill,
returning from Sunday-school, met Little Bit who
had been waiting for him at the corner for an hour.
The two boys played around the streets for a
while, then wandered aimlessly down the alley
and into a vacant place in the rear of the Gaitskill
store. There they found something which interested
them very much.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was a discarded advertisement.</p>

<p class='c005'>A piece of cardboard, life-size, represented a
big, grinning negro man. Both arms were folded
across his chest and he was hugging a brand of
cured meat called the Hallelujah Ham to his bosom
while his great mouth was wide-spread in a toothsome
grin of anticipation over its sugar-cured
sweetness. Having served its purpose, this cardboard
man had been tossed upon the trash heap to
be carted away. Org and Little Bit beat the
trash man to it and regarded it as a great possession.</p>

<p class='c005'>They carried the thing to the corner of the street
and set it up in the middle of the alley.</p>

<p class='c005'>A negro woman passed, humming a tune. When
she saw the big negro, she jumped to one side with
loud bawl:</p>

<p class='c005'>“My Gawd! Who you tryin’ to skeer?”</p>

<p class='c005'>When she saw it was merely a cardboard standing
up, she went laughing down the street.</p>

<p class='c005'>“This is our lucky day, Little Bit,” Org
chuckled. “We can have a heap of fun with this
<a id='Page_118'></a>thing. There is plenty of fun scaring people if
they don’t get mad and fight you afterwards.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Niggers don’t fight when dey is skeart,” Little
Bit said. “Dey runs.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But we can’t play with this to-day,” Org said
virtuously, recalling his recent Sunday-school instructions.
“This is the Sabbath of the Lord and
this big negro man ought to rest on this day. We’ll
take him up to my house and lay him down in the
stable so he can rest.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Restin’ time an’ Sonday shore sounds good to
a nigger,” Little Bit giggled. “Even dis here
paper pasteboard man is a-grinnin’.”</p>

<p class='c005'>But this was not a day of rest at the Gaitskill
home. They were arranging to give a great dinner
that evening at which would be announced the
engagement of Miss Virginia Gaitskill and Captain
Kerley Kerlerac.</p>

<p class='c005'>All day long Hopey Prophet, famous cook, was
preparing that dinner, Dazzle Zenor was helping
in the kitchen, Mustard Prophet was errand boy,
Skeeter Butts was slipping in and out of Hopey’s
cabin in the yard, seizing such opportunities as he
could find to discuss with Mustard the return of
the rabbit-foot.</p>

<p class='c005'>Org was called in and impressively informed
that his beautiful sister was engaged to Captain
Kerlerac and the announcement would be made
that evening; that he would not be permitted to
be at the dinner because he had to be corrected
<a id='Page_119'></a>seventeen times at an ordinary meal, and this
occasion was so extraordinary that he was eliminated.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I don’t care—I’m glad I’m out of it,” Org
growled. “Gince didn’t ask me nothing about
her business and I’m not going to help her through.
Let old Gince go and get herself engaged. Little
Bit says that Cap’n Kerley is a easy boss.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What I want you to do is to be a good boy all
day and stay around the house,” Mrs. Gaitskill
requested.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ll promise not to leave this place all day,” Org
said. “There’s nothin’ doing on Sunday nohow.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Thank you,” Mrs. Gaitskill said, much relieved
by the promise. “If you are very good, I’ll
promise to do something very nice for you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Will you lemme have a party and invite Little
Bit?” Org asked.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, dear! I can’t promise what I will do just
now,” Mrs. Gaitskill smiled.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Say!” Org exclaimed, struck by a sudden
thought. “Don’t I get anything to eat out of
this?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Certainly. But you’ll have to wait until the
others have eaten.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Is Little Bit in on the eats, too?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“We’ll be good,” Org announced.</p>

<p class='c005'>And he kept his promise. He and Little Bit
played in the stable all day long. About dark it
<a id='Page_120'></a>pleased his fancy to carry his cardboard negro man
to the house where there could be no danger of anyone
stealing it. At first he thought he would take
it up to his own room, then he decided to store it in
a room which Colonel Gaitskill called his “office,”
for he knew that no one would enter that room
that night.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Gaitskill home was arranged in this fashion:
Entering the front door a guest stepped into the
reception room in the rear of which was a staircase
leading to the bed-rooms above. On the left
of the reception room was the dining-room, behind
that the butler’s pantry and the kitchen. In the
rear of the staircase was a back hall with a flight
of back stairs leading to the bed-rooms above.
On the right of the reception room was the drawing-room,
and in the rear of that, entered by
folding doors, was what Mrs. Gaitskill called
a library, and Miss Virginia called a den, and
Colonel Gaitskill called his office.</p>

<p class='c005'>In this “office” Org set up his cardboard man,
knowing that Gaitskill never entered this room on
Sunday, and that no guest would be admitted to
it that night.</p>

<p class='c005'>As Org came out of the room, he was captured
by Dazzle Zenor, who conducted him to his room,
ordered him to bathe, and superintended his dressing.
Then she dismissed him with instructions
not to leave the house and hastened to assist Miss
Virginia with her toilet.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_121'></a>Orren sneaked down to the dining-room and
gazed with awe at the wonderfully picturesque
table; boylike, he began to seek what he might
devour. There was nothing good to eat on the
table yet, nothing on the sideboard. He pulled
open a door in the sideboard, and found far back
a cut-glass dish full of candies.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oo-oo!” he exclaimed. “Candy mints! They
put ’em way back here to hide ’em from me!” and
he filled his pockets.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then he smuggled Little Bit up-stairs to his
room to keep him company, and showed him the
candy mints.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dat looks good to me,” the little negro said.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I bet it’ll make our mouths run water to eat
’em. When eatin’ time comes, us is gwine expe’unce
joy.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“We’ll lay ’em on this table till everybody goes
to eating down-stairs,” Org said.</p>

<p class='c005'>There were some Tickfall notables at that
dinner.</p>

<p class='c005'>There was Dr. Sentelle, clergyman, a hang-over
from Civil War times, an unreconstructed rebel, a
cripple since Antietam, whose voice was music,
whose speech was eloquence, and every word a
caress; whose face was beautiful, written all over
with the literature of experience. There was John
Flournoy, who had served forty years as sheriff
of the Parish, a man with the physical frame of an
ox, the strength of Samson, a mouth like a bear
<a id='Page_122'></a>trap, and the gentle heart of a woman—the little
children followed him on the streets. There was
Judge Haddan, a pale, sickly man with a weak
voice, trembling hands, and the stooped shoulders
of the student; but his head was massive and Websterian,
his eyes glowed like the eyes of some jungle
beast, and no man within the borders of the State
commanded more respect as a lawyer and a jurist.
There was Colonel Gaitskill, the host, serene,
powerful, with his snow-white beard and hair, his
face glowing like an alabaster vase with a lamp in
it, such a man as one beholds once in a lifetime
and remembers forever. And around these a bevy
of women and girls who had known these men
since their babyhood.</p>

<p class='c005'>And there was the girl of the evening, Miss
Virginia Harwick Gaitskill, descendant of a long
line of beautiful women and handsome men, her
skin like the faint iridescence of pearls, her eyes
like cornflower sapphires, her hair like cobweb,
thick and wavy, colored like the heart of a ripe
chestnut burr, her whole face like pearl and pomegranate
and peachbloom, with the amber nimbus
above it always from that soft brown hair, her
laughter light and happy like a Sicilian shepherd’s
reed, and her heart like oil on salt sea-water—all
the beauties of the world moving, circling, advancing,
retreating, but smoothing out all ruffled surfaces
and stilling the storm!</p>

<p class='c005'>And Captain Kerley Kerlerac, such a man as
<a id='Page_123'></a>every mother wants her son to be that he might
fill her heart and satisfy her love completely—but
it is customary to ignore the man in a case like
this, or dismiss him with faint praise.</p>

<p class='c005'>The dinner was about half finished when Little
Bit, in Orren’s room up-stairs, looked longingly
at the candy mints upon the little table and remarked:</p>

<p class='c005'>“All dem eaters down dar makes me feel
hongry.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Me, too. Less eat our candy mints,” Org
suggested.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ll bet dey’ll make my mouf water when I gits
’em inside,” Little Bit chuckled. “My mouf is
been waterin’ jes’ to look at ’em.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Indeed, they did make his mouth water.</p>

<p class='c005'>These candy mints were not what Orren Randolph
Gaitskill thought they were. They were
shaped like candy mints, but they contained no
candy and no mint; they were little wafers, which
dropped in water in the finger-bowls, would effervesce,
causing the water to bubble and sparkle
and look pretty.</p>

<p class='c005'>Both boys grabbed a handful of these things
and poured them in their mouths.</p>

<p class='c005'>They tasted sweet. The saliva moistened them,
and suddenly one of them exploded in each mouth.
It was a very slight explosion, just enough to
cause all the tablets to crumble into tiny pieces
and get under their tongues and between their
<a id='Page_124'></a>teeth, and fill the entire cavity of the mouth like
an expanding balloon.</p>

<p class='c005'>When the explosion occurred in Little Bit’s
mouth, that little darky felt like the whole top of
his head had been blown off, and he opened his
mouth and uttered a startled bellow.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then in both mouths, each little globule began
to explode as the moisture penetrated it. Half a
dozen popped under each tongue, several cracked
between the teeth of the boys, and the vibration
of the nerves of the teeth made them feel as if there
was a sound like a pistol shot at each tiny explosion.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Poison!” Org gurgled.</p>

<p class='c005'>“P’ison!” Little Bit seconded.</p>

<p class='c005'>The two boys decided that they needed expert
medical attention at once. Dr. Moseley was
down in the dining-room. They would not wait
for him to come up; they would go down to him!
They ran down the hall and galloped down the
back steps, their feet making as much racket as a
pair of mules crossing the gangplank of a steamboat.
They burst into the dining-room, foaming
at the mouth, their frothy tongues protruding,
gargling their words as they tried to speak. Little
Bit, his coal-black face smeared with foamy white
bubbles, looked like he had swallowed the handle of
a shaving brush and left the soapy end sticking
out!</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’m poisoned!” Org gargled.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_125'></a>“My Gawd! I’m p’isoned!” Little Bit squalled.</p>

<p class='c005'>Simultaneously with the startling advent of the
children in the dining-room, there came a scream,
so shrill, so terror-fraught, so penetrating, that all
the guests sprang to their feet in consternation.</p>

<p class='c005'>From the kitchen, Dazzle Zenor’s voice sounded
like a steam whistle:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, my Gawd! A alligator is tryin’ to git in
dis kitchen!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Almost instantly in the reception room there
was a sound like the delivery of a ton of coal——</p>

<p class='c005'>Skeeter Butts had fallen down-stairs!</p>

<p class='c005'>Hopey Prophet, hearing all the commotion,
started from the pantry to see what it was about;
glancing across the back hall into Colonel Tom
Gaitskill’s office, she beheld a strange negro man
with a broad grin on his black face, hugging a
Hallelujah Ham to his bosom!</p>

<p class='c005'>She hurled herself into the dining-room among
the astounded guests, her fat arms stretched up
toward the ceiling, her dough-like face ashen with
fright as she bawled at the top of her voice:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Fer Gade ’lmighty’s sake, white folks! Dar’s
a big nigger man in Marse Tom’s library!”</p>

<p class='c005'>When Mustard Prophet heard Dazzle’s scream
of fright, he rushed from a little side porch where
he was waiting to serve the cream when they were
ready, taking a pistol from his pocket as he ran.
There had been no doubt in Mustard’s mind that
he had really seen an alligator in the orchard the
<a id='Page_126'></a>day before and he had armed himself for protection
in case he saw it again.</p>

<p class='c005'>But before Mustard got to the kitchen, he heard
the sound made by Skeeter Butts in his tumble
down the front stairs, so he changed his course and
started in that direction.</p>

<p class='c005'>Just as Mustard arrived in the reception room,
he heard Hopey’s wild whoop and her statement
that a strange negro was in the library. So Mustard
ran across the drawing-room floor, pushed
open the folding doors and entered the library,
knocking over in his haste a cardboard representation
of a negro man who stood holding a Hallelujah
Ham to his bosom. Approaching from the rear
of this figure, Mustard could not see what it
was. It fell face downward and nobody recognized
it.</p>

<p class='c005'>Captain Kerley Kerlerac hastily excused himself
from the table, stepped into the back hall on
his way to the library. Looking about for a suitable
weapon, he laid hold upon Orren’s baseball
bat standing in the corner.</p>

<p class='c005'>He entered the library through one door just as
Mustard entered it through the other. Kerlerac
closed his door behind him, thus shutting out the
light from the little back hall by which Hopey had
been able to see the cardboard figure, and which
would have shown Kerlerac that the negro was
Mustard whom he confronted. But Kerlerac
was in the dark, and Mustard had the light from
<a id='Page_127'></a>the drawing-room behind him. What Kerlerac
saw was a big negro with a big pistol in his hand.</p>

<p class='c005'>The battle began at once!</p>

<p class='c005'>Mustard shot ten times at Captain Kerlerac,
the bullets flying in every direction. Three of
them entered the dining-room among the guests,
having no effect except to splash the diners out
of that room, like a brick splashes water when
dropped into a puddle of mud!</p>

<p class='c005'>The last bullet in Mustard’s pistol skimmed
along the cheek of Kerlerac, making a long, painful
cut, just under the lobe of his ear, adding one
more bullet wound to the two he had previously
received when he was fighting for Uncle Sam in
the world war.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then the captain’s baseball bat landed on the
top of Mustard’s head and Mustard sank to the
floor unconscious.</p>

<p class='c005'>Kerlerac walked over with the intention of
pounding the negro’s head to a jelly, but just
then——</p>

<p class='c005'>From a little house in the yard by the side of the
residence, there sounded the thrilling scream of
Miss Virginia Gaitskill. The woman he loved!
A moment later she began to shriek, and in her
tones were all the concentrated essence of agonized
terror!</p>

<p class='c005'>Miss Virginia, in her effort to escape from the
flying bullets, had run out of the house through
the kitchen. As she rushed out of the door into
<a id='Page_128'></a>the yard, the light from the door shone full into
the eyes of a six-foot alligator. He opened his
mouth wide at her approach, and when she
screamed, he snapped his jaws like a bear-trap!</p>

<p class='c005'>The shrieking girl fled for refuge to the storehouse.</p>

<p class='c005'>Alas!</p>

<p class='c005'>A stream of sweetness from a barrel of ribbon-cane
sirup had been running from the spigot for
two days and one night. Over the floor of that
storehouse was a pool of molasses one inch deep.</p>

<p class='c005'>Virginia stepped into that mess and both her
dainty slippers stuck! She screamed. She tried
to retreat and stepped out of both her slippers,
and her feet stood ankle-deep in the molasses.
Then came a series of shrieks which were the essence
of agonized terror!</p>

<p class='c005'>Captain Kerley Kerlerac, leaving Mustard unconscious
upon the floor, ran to the rescue of the
beauty in distress. Plunging out of the kitchen
door, he leaped over something which looked like
an old mud-caked log, and which snapped at him
viciously as he passed.</p>

<p class='c005'>Failing to get a bite of the captain’s leg, the
alligator walked around to the front of the house.</p>

<p class='c005'>Kerlerac hurled himself through the door of the
storehouse like a catapult.</p>

<p class='c005'>Alas for the hero! Both feet landed in the molasses,
both feet slipped from under him, he fell
flat on his back, rolled over and over in the sweetness,
<a id='Page_129'></a>and stopped his progress only when both
feet struck against the empty barrel from which
all that saccharine had dripped!</p>

<p class='c005'>He sprang up, threw his sweet arms around the
woman he loved, drew her close to his sirupy form,
laid his bleeding cheek against her amber hair, and
carried her forth to safety!</p>

<p class='c005'>In the meantime, Skeeter Butts was lying in
the reception room under a leather couch, grasping
the green-plush box in his nervous hand.</p>

<p class='c005'>He had started up-stairs to restore it to its
rightful owner, just as Org and Little Bit, thinking
they were poisoned, had run down the hallway
above in their flight to the dining-room. Skeeter
had turned his body to retreat, had lost his balance,
and had fallen down the steps, taking refuge
under the leather couch, where he was happy to
remain during the subsequent scenes of that
memorable night.</p>

<p class='c005'>When the screams of Miss Virginia Gaitskill
attracted all the guests to the rear of the house,
Skeeter crawled from under the couch, crawled
across the reception room, slipped out of the front
door and began to crawl toward the gate.</p>

<p class='c005'>Someone in the house turned the electric switch,
causing the globe light on the front porch to flash
up. Skeeter jumped, hastily concealed himself
behind a bit of shrubbery, and glancing around
him nervously, found himself squatting within
two feet of an immense alligator.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_130'></a>The alligator opened his mouth like a door to
the pit of the nether regions, and Skeeter, with
that peculiar impulse which everyone has to
strike, or throw something, at a peril, hurled the
green-plush box into the alligator’s gaping mouth!</p>

<p class='c005'>The jaws snapped together and the box containing
the rabbit-foot was gone.</p>

<p class='c005'>By that time Skeeter was gone too.</p>

<p class='c005'>As soon as Mustard Prophet was identified,
half a dozen armed men from the dinner party
patroled the lawn with guns and flash-lights, hunting
for the negro whom Hopey had seen. The
alligator, disturbed by the flash-light, which
whipped across the grass, crawled under the fence
into the horse-pasture, and was there discovered
and killed by Sheriff Flournoy.</p>

<p class='c005'>Skeeter Butts, who was hiding in the bushes
just across the road, drew a big sigh of relief.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dem white mens is done killed a alligator
whut’s got five foots an’ dey don’t know it,” he
chuckled. “One foot is gone down de red lane
of his gullet in a cute green box!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Skeeter waited until the men returned to the
house and then moved away.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I knows whar dat rabbit-foot is,” he muttered.
“But I ain’t gwine atter it. No Jonah in de
whale fer me!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Over in the negro settlement called Dirty-Six,
Skeeter entered the Hen-Scratch saloon, saying
nothing of the exciting scenes he had witnessed
<a id='Page_131'></a>that night. But his mind dwelt upon them, as
evidenced by a song which he sang again and
again:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Some folks do not believe</div>
      <div class='line'>Dat a whale could Jonah receive</div>
      <div class='line'>But dat don’t make my tale a-tall untrue.</div>
      <div class='line'>Dar are whales on eve’y side</div>
      <div class='line'>Wid deir mouths open wide</div>
      <div class='line'>An’ you better look out or one will swallow you!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<h3 class='c010'>XVIII<br /> <br />THE KISS</h3>

<p class='c011'>Ten days had passed.</p>

<p class='c005'>At the Nigger-Heel plantation Mustard Prophet,
nursing a battered head, was curing an alligator
skin which he had nailed upon a barn door, and
was keeping careful guard over two green-plush
boxes, each containing a rabbit-foot.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mustard entered the junk-room full of Marse
Tom’s curiosities, opened a drawer in a desk, and
brought forth the two luck charms which had
caused him so much trouble.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It ’pears to me like dese here lef’ hind foots is
lost dere power,” he muttered to himself.</p>

<p class='c005'>He held up one box which looked rather messy,
because Mustard had rescued it from an alligator’s
stomach. He continued his soliloquy:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Now you take de hist’ry of dis here foot:
<a id='Page_132'></a>Cap’n Kerlerac gib dis’n to Miss Virginia Gaitskill
fifteen years ago when she warn’t nothin’ but
a little ole spindle-leg gal. An’ whut come to pass?
Her paw an’ maw died in furin parts somewhar an’
she had to move back to Tickfall. Little Bit tole
little Marse Org dat a rabbit-foot fotch luck, so
he stole dis’n out of his sister’s room, swiped a pipe
an’ smoked rabbit terbacker, an’ mighty nigh
died. When Skeeter Butts tuck Org home an
seen dis rabbit-foot, he thought it wus mine an’ I
thought it wus mine because it looked jes’ like
mine. So I sneaked up to Miss Virginia’s room
to steal it back, an’ I had my hand on de very place
whar it wus, when dat little ole Org boy skeart de
gizzard outen me, playin’ Indian an’ whoopin’
behime my back.</p>

<p class='c005'>“An’ Skeeter swiped dis foot fer me, an’ hopped
in his automobile to make his escapement, an’ he
run off a busted bridge into de Cooley bayou,
chased by all de hawgs an’ sheeps an’ cattle an’
hosses an’ mules an’ dawgs an’ mens in Tickfall.
Atter dat, Skeeter tried to fotch dis rabbit-foot
back to Miss Virginia because it ’twarn’t de one
we wanted, an’ he had dis foot on his own pusson
when he tuck dat hell-bustin’ tumble down Marse
Tom’s steps, an’ he had it in his hand when he
snuck across de yard an’ dat alligator tried to eat
him up. Den Skeeter throwed dis rabbit-foot,
plush box an’ all, down dat alligator’s gullet, an’
whut happened to dat varmint atter he swallowed
<a id='Page_133'></a>dis foot, an’ had all de luck inside his own hide?
He got kilt!”</p>

<p class='c005'>He laid this unlucky foot back in the green-plush
box, placed it reverently in the drawer, shaking
his head over the mystery how a luck charm
could be attended with so much misfortune.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Naw, suh, dis’n is done lost de power,” he
announced.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then he lifted the other green-plush box, lifted
a rabbit-foot out of it, and gazed with sacred awe
upon this talisman.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dis here is Marse Tom’s left hind foot of a
rabbit kilt in a graveyard in de dark of de moon,”
he announced. “But take de secret myst’ry of de
hist’ry of dis here foot: it wus in Marse Tom’s
own house when all dat rousement touck place an’
busted up Miss Virginia’s party. An’ I had dis
foot in my own coat pocket on my own pussonal
self when Cap’n Kerley busted my head wid dat
bat an’ I mighty nigh shot his snout off wid my
pistol!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Mustard Prophet reached up and tenderly
caressed a bandage upon his wounded head.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Naw, suh,” he sighed. “’Tain’t resomble to
me dat dis foot is still got de authority. I’ll keep
it, but I don’t never trust it no more. Mr. On-lucky
Foot, I axes you good-by!”</p>

<p class='c005'>He solemnly placed his thick lips upon the
cushiony bottom of the rabbit’s foot, and kissed
it farewell.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_134'></a>In Gaitskill’s stable in Tickfall, an ideal playhouse
for two boys, Orren Randolph Gaitskill and
Little Bit had formed a joint ownership over eleven
interesting objects: One baseball bat which had
“busted a nigger’s head,” and ten pistol bullets
which had been extracted from the walls in the
Gaitskill home. At frequent intervals an argument
started between them as to which of the ten
bullets had wounded Captain Kerley Kerlerac in
the face.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ef I knowed which one it wus, I’d shore tote
it roun’ wid me fer luck,” Little Bit said.</p>

<p class='c005'>“This bat is a lucky bat. It blooded Mustard’s
head. But we can’t carry it around for luck,”
Org said.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Naw, suh, but we can kiss it fer luck,” Little
Bit proclaimed.</p>

<p class='c005'>“That’s right,” Org said. “You kiss one end
and I’ll kiss the other.”</p>

<p class='c005'>They solemnly held it up between them, and
white lips and black lips caressed opposite ends of
the big stick.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the Gaitskill home, Captain Kerley Kerlerac
entered and asked for Virginia. This was his tenth
call since the night of the dinner ten days before.
But now, for the first time, the bandage was removed
from his face.</p>

<p class='c005'>A long red scar marked the face from the point
of the chin to the lobe of the ear.</p>

<p class='c005'>For the first time Virginia saw that mark which
<a id='Page_135'></a>he would carry to his grave. Kerlerac noticed
that look of distress, but he had a little question
which he often asked, and it always had the effect
of diverting her mind from anything, however important,
to something which was vastly more
important.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Do you love me as much as ever?” he asked
quietly.</p>

<p class='c005'>But the girl could not take her eyes from the long
red scar. Her chin quivered with emotion and
her lips drooped with the pain of the thought of
that night of comedy when he had to suffer this
wound.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Stoop over and I’ll tell you,” she whispered.</p>

<p class='c005'>He bent his head to hear the whisper from her
fragrant lips.</p>

<p class='c005'>She put both arms around his neck and kissed
the scar upon his cheek.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>The ’Fraid-Cat</h2>
</div>
<h3 class='c010'>I</h3>
<p class='c011'>“I’s glad de kunnel an’ ole miss is gone to
N’Awleens,” Hopey Prophet remarked as she sank
her thickly upholstered body into a deeply upholstered
chair in the Gaitskill drawing-room. “I
likes to take a seat an’ set down in de white folks’
parlor an’ ack white.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“If de kunnel knowed we wus settin’ in dis boodwar,
he’d bu’st our necks,” Dazzle Zenor giggled
as she sat down on the stool at the grand piano
and ran her slim ebony fingers over the white keys.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ll shore fergit to tell him whar we spent our
time while he wus gone,” Hopey chuckled, as she
raised herself from the chair and waddled across
the room to turn on all the electric lights. “Whut
Marse Tom ain’t know won’t hurt us.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I needs a beau to entertain me in dis nice
room,” Dazzle smiled, looking up at the chandelier
now blazing with light. “All dis noble arrangement
is wasted on me ’thout no man to see
me in de middle of it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dat remark shows dat Skeeter Butts is still
<a id='Page_137'></a>pesterin’ yo’ mind,” Hopey told her. “Ef he
takes a notion to pay a call-visit, I’ll shore set
right here an’ chapperoon him.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Us won’t need you,” the girl remarked in a
dreamy tone as she ran her fingers down the keyboard
of the piano. “Skeeter shore do look brave
in his soldier suit.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Brave!” Hopey snorted. “Brave! Dat
Skeeter Butts is de biggest coward in de Nunited
States of Loozanny!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“He ain’t!” Dazzle protested.</p>

<p class='c005'>“He am!” Hopey insisted, nodding her big
head on her fat shoulders. “Skeeter ain’t never
seed nothin’ in his life dat he wusn’t skeart of.
He’s a nachel-bawn ’fraid-cat!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I don’t b’lieve dat,” Dazzle snapped. “Didn’t
he go off an’ jine de army at de fust off-startin’ of
de war?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Suttin he did!” Hopey chuckled. “But how
come? Three nigger womens wus in dis town on
de very same day; each one had a weddin’ license
to marry Skeeter Butts—an’ you wus one of dem
three womens! An’ whut did Skeeter up an’ do?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“He volunteered to jine de army.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Shore! He wus forced to volunteer! Don’t
dat show he’s a coward an’ a ’fraid-cat?” Hopey
howled. “Why didn’t he stay in Tickfall like a
brave man an’ marry dem three nigger womens?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“He didn’t run because he wus skeart,” Dazzle
asserted in Skeeter’s defense. “He jined de army
<a id='Page_138'></a>because a lifelong war wid three nigger women
wifes is too much of a muchness fer even a brave
soldier like Skeeter.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I wish dat Mr. Bill Kaiser’s war had kotch
him,” Hopey growled disloyally. “I bet dem
Hunches would ’a’ throwed a skeer into Skeeter dat
mought ’a’ skeart all de skeer out of him.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Skeeter wus a brave soldier,” Dazzle repeated
obstinately.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Soldier!” Hopey repeated with a contemptuous
sniff. “Skeeter wusn’t nothin’ but a boot-black
in de army, totin’ pink notes to de kunnel
fer de lady folks.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Skeeter told me dat him an’ de military kunnel
looked fer Mr. Bill Kaiser eve’ywhar,” Dazzle
informed her. “It wus Mr. Bill dat wus skeart of
Skeeter. He hid out, an’ Skeeter couldn’t connect
up wid him or find him nowhars. Skeeter is a
dangersome nigger.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Skeeter wus jes’ tryin’ to locate Mr. Kaiser so
he would know whut place to stay away from,”
Hopey growled. “He imagined he warn’t skeart
of de Hunches, but he warn’t aimin’ to let de
Hunches <i>run</i> him.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“’Tain’t so,” Dazzle answered sharply. “I
bet ef I wus in danger right now, Skeeter would
come up here an’ rescue me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Suttinly,” Hopey grumbled. “Fust-off, he’d
break a leg runnin’ up to Sheriff Flournoy’s orfice to
git de sheriff to he’p him, because he growed up in
<a id='Page_139'></a>Marse John’s house, an’ he is de sheriff’s little pet
nigger. Next-off, he’d git all de white folks an’
niggers in town and lead ’em up on dis hill. Den
he’d sneak aroun’ behime a tree an’ wait till de
rookus wus over, an’ at de last he’d hop in an’ ack
like he done it all!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Dazzle was angry. She glared at Hopey with
fine rage, and tried to think of something to say
that would crush the fat woman flat. But nothing
but a falling planet would ever flatten Hopey, so
that young colored actress with several histrionic
manifestations of intense indignation flounced out
of the room, followed by the exasperating chuckles
of the victorious Hopey Prophet.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the rear hallway Dazzle paused at sight of
the telephone. Her milk-white teeth gnawed at
her lower lip as she debated something in her
mind. Then, with an air of decision, she sat
down at the desk and lifted the receiver from the
hook.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Central, I wants to talk to de Hen-Scratch
saloon, please, ma’am!”</p>

<p class='c005'>After a moment’s wait something popped in her
ear, and a voice spoke: “Hello!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Is dat you, Skeeter Butts? Listen! Dis
here am Dazzle Zenor. I’s at Marse Tom Gaitskill’s
home wid Hopey Prophet. Somebody is
tryin’ to bu’st in dis house an’ rob it——”</p>

<p class='c005'>A squealing shriek sounded so sharply in
Dazzle’s ear that she jerked her head away from
<a id='Page_140'></a>the receiver, ceased speaking, and waited until
the vocal disturbances had subsided.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dey is tryin’ to bu’st in de front door,
Skeeter!” Dazzle told him. “Me an’ Hopey lef’
de kitchen door onlocked so Vinegar Atts could
come in when he got back. Ef dem robbers goes
aroun’ to de back side de house, dey’ll shore git in.
Come up here right away an’ rescue us!”</p>

<p class='c005'>A squealing interrogation sounded through the
phone, and Dazzle smiled as she answered:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dar ain’t more’n seven robbers, Skeeter. But
you kin lick ’em like you done in de army. Don’t
git skeart!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Although Skeeter’s reply was not intelligible,
his shrieking voice, in reply, was audible even in
the drawing-room, where Hopey sat shaking like
a jelly-bowl with laughter.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Come all alone by yo’se’f, Skeeter!” Dazzle
implored him. “Us don’t want no crowd up here
an’ no excitemunt. Don’t tell no white folks!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Dazzle paused to listen to a few more excited
squawkings from the telephone, then she commanded:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Come by yo’se’f, an’ come in a hurry, befo’ I
gits kilt! Fer Gawd’s sake, hurry, Skeeter!”</p>

<p class='c005'>She left the telephone and entered the room
where Hopey sat, smiling with great satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You done played a fool now!” Hopey told her.</p>

<p class='c005'>Dazzle preened herself before a mirror in preparation
for Skeeter’s arrival.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_141'></a>“Skeeter’s comin’, Hopey,” Dazzle giggled.
“’Tain’t no matter how big a coward a feller is,
he’s afraid to cornfess dat he’s a ’fraid-cat!”</p>
<h3 class='c010'>II</h3>

<p class='c011'>Skeeter Butts hung up the receiver at his end of
the line and staggered across the Hen-Scratch saloon.
His face was convulsed, and the odd distortions
due to the contraction and relaxation of
its muscles would lead one to believe that an electric
shock received over the telephone had twisted
his face and he was trying to set it right.</p>

<p class='c005'>Skeeter had received a shock. Four friends,
beholding him, noted that his face was bloodless,
his yellow fingers trembled and were beyond his
control, his knees shook and buckled under him as
he walked, and his chin was aquiver.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Bad luck, niggers,” he whined through chattering
teeth. “A band of robbers has busted into
Marse Tom Gaitskill’s house, an’ dey is killin’
Dazzle Zenor.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The four men sitting at the table quivered with
excitement mingled with fear. With that emotional
race, any sort of excitement is expressed
by noise, but fear calls for silence. For a brief
time the silence was so great that the five could
distinctly hear the ticking of Hitch Diamond’s big
silver watch.</p>

<p class='c005'>Hitch Diamond, the big prize-fighter, sat in a
<a id='Page_142'></a>rickety chair. As he meditated upon the possibilities
of the case which Skeeter had stated, and
his emotions increased, that chair produced an
irritating squeak with every inhalation and expulsion
of Hitch’s breath. All the noise produced in
that room was caused by Hitch’s watch and his
chair. The rest were like frightened quail that
squat and try to merge with the scenery.</p>

<p class='c005'>It seemed to be a long, long time before anyone
ventured to break that oppressive silence. Finally
Hitch spoke bravely:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Go up an’ rescue Dazzle, Skeeter. I’ll be
glad to stay behime an’ take keer of de saloon.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Four chairs moved uneasily, emitting a scraping
sound. Figger Bush pulled a corncob pipe from
his pocket, and his trembling hands caused the
stem to drop from the cob and fall under the
table. Figger stooped to pick it up, found that
it was dark under the table, and straightened up
without his pipe-stem. He could get that pipe-stem
to-morrow.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Me, too,” Figger Bush quacked. “I’ll he’p
Hitchie keep de saloon.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Mustard Prophet, the scientific agriculturist of
the party, took a big red apple from his pocket
and bit deeply into its juicy substance. He was
trying to appear disinterested, but his favorite
kind of apple was tasteless to him now.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dar ain’t no use fer de rest of us to go,” Mustard
muttered thickly, munching at his apple, and
<a id='Page_143'></a>glancing at Pap Curtain. “Skeeter kin handle
de case——”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You got to go wid me, Mustard,” Skeeter interrupted.
“Dazzle tole me dat Hopey wus in de
house, too—an’ de robbers is killin’ her.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The part of the apple Mustard held in his fingers
slipped away and rolled across the saloon floor;
the part he had in his mouth strangled in his
quivering throat.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dat’s too bad,” he announced in a tone of disinterested
sympathy. “But dat serves Hopey
right, an’ she deeserves all she gits. Me an’ my
nigger wife don’t speak no more. I went dar to-night,
an’ axed Hopey to gimme some hot biscuits
an’ a few sirup, an’ she wouldn’t do it!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I think dis here is yo’ job, Skeeter,” Pap Curtain
snarled, the habitual sneer upon his face
becoming more acute and repulsive as he tried to
conceal his timidity. “Dazzle didn’t want none
of us buttin’ in, or she’d axed fer us. Ef you wants
to make a hit wid Dazzle, you got to pick up a
brave heart an’ go out dar an’ kill dat band of
robbers—jes’ like when you wus in de army.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But us army soldiers didn’t do no fightin’ all
by our lonely selfs,” Skeeter wailed. “We fi’t an’
bled an’ died in regimints!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You oughter hab fotch yo’ army home wid
you,” Pap sneered. “Somepin like dis might
happen sudden any time, an’ you knowed you’d
need it.”</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_144'></a>The telephone rang sharply, and every man
jumped with fright.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Gosh, dat skeart me!” Pap Curtain exclaimed.
“Answer de telerphome, Skeeter.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Answer de telerphome, Figger,” Skeeter
squalled, feeling nervously in all his pockets as if
he were hunting for the most important thing in
the world and could not abandon the search.</p>

<p class='c005'>“My shoe-string is come ontied,” Figger answered
as he bent over his foot. “You answer de
phome, Mustard!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Mustard did not move. The telephone bell
subsided with a final little tinkle.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dar now, it’s too late!” Mustard lamented. “I’d
’a’ answered, only but I’m total deef in one y-ear.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The telephone rang again, sharply, insistently;
rang for a good five minutes.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Answer it, Hitch Diamond!” Skeeter wailed
in the midst of the sound.</p>

<p class='c005'>Hitch pretended not to hear.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I bet dat is Hopey telerphomin’ me dat she’s
dead,” Mustard Prophet muttered in pitiful fright.
“I won’t never git no more hot biscuits. Hopey
wus shore a good cook an’ a good wife. Us had
little spats, but dar warn’t never no hard feelin’s.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Come on, fellers,” Skeeter interrupted. “Less
go up on de hill an’ see whut’s happened.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I ain’t gwine in dat house!” Pap Curtain exclaimed.
“I don’t like to see blood spilt aroun’
all over Marse Tom’s nice carpets.”</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_145'></a>“I hope dey don’t spile de floor too much,”
Hitch grumbled as he rose to his feet. “Marse
Tom always makes me scrub up de messes because
Hopey’s too dang fat to lean over.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ll let Pap guard de front of de house an’ hide
behime de big pecan-tree,” Skeeter announced,
glad enough to get company. “Hitch kin guard
de kitchen by hidin’ behime de meat-house. Figger
an’ Mustard kin guard each side of de house by
layin’ on de groun’ outside de lawn-fence.”</p>

<p class='c005'>While Skeeter was issuing these orders, Little
Bit had entered the saloon, and stood listening.
When Skeeter ended, he spoke:</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’s gwine guard de Hen-Scratch by hidin’ behime
de bar counter,” he giggled, without an idea
what all the excitement was about.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Whar you been at, you little debbil?” Skeeter
Butts snapped, whirling about to face the Hen-Scratch’s
factotum. “You stay an’ keep dis
saloon—an’ ef de telerphome rings, you answer it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Skeeter ran to a little safe in the corner of the
saloon and brought forth four guns, which he distributed
to their rightful owners; then he took his
own automatic from behind the bar, and the five
negroes started in a swift run for Gaitskill’s home.</p>

<p class='c005'>By the time they had climbed to the top of the
hill on which the fine colonial home was located,
they entered the yard, breathless and panting.
From that high point they could look out over the
village, glowing in the darkness like a great firefly,
<a id='Page_146'></a>with its countless lights on the crooked streets
and its glowing windows. But their attention was
concentrated upon the house before them. The
drawing-room glowed with brilliant light.</p>

<p class='c005'>Four of the men quickly went to the places assigned
them and dropped down in hiding. Skeeter
sneaked from shrub to shrub, lay down and
crawled around rose-bushes, ran from the shelter
of one tree across the exposed and open places to
the grateful shelter of another tree, until he came
close to one of the lighted windows. Reaching
up, he straddled the limb over his head and looked
fearfully into the drawing-room.</p>

<p class='c005'>He saw Hopey and Dazzle seated very comfortably.
They seemed to be very much amused
at something, for they laughed constantly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dis here is some kind of joke,” Skeeter muttered
to himself as he dropped from the limb. “I’ll
sneak in de kitchen an’ come through de house
an’ supprise ’em.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Slipping to the rear, he emitted a low whistle
and located Hitch Diamond by the meat-house,
which gave him the courage to open the door of
the dark kitchen and enter.</p>

<p class='c005'>There was not a negro in this rescue-party who
was not thoroughly familiar with the Gaitskill
home. In the years past they had served in that
house in every capacity, and knew every room and
closet, and the contents of each. There were a
dozen other homes in Tickfall with which they
<a id='Page_147'></a>were equally familiar, for the good house servant
is a privileged character in the house, and his
presence in the home is coveted by every housekeeper.</p>

<p class='c005'>So it was no trouble for Skeeter to find his way
in the dark to the lighted drawing-room.</p>

<p class='c005'>A bellow of fright from Hopey and a squeal of
terror from Dazzle greeted him as he stepped from
behind a door with a pistol in his hand.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Whut you got to say now, Hopey?” Dazzle
exclaimed, when she recovered from her fright.
“I tole you Skeeter wus a brave nigger——”</p>

<p class='c005'>There was a loud clatter at the front door, and
Pap Curtain’s voice spoke:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Open dis door, Skeeter! Hurry!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Skeeter sprang to the door and threw it open.
Little Bit, panting, dripping with perspiration,
and almost exhausted, was pushed into the room
by Pap Curtain, who had to support him to prevent
his falling to the floor. In the blaze of light
which came through the open door, Figger and
Mustard and Hitch got the courage to come out
from their hiding-places and listen.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Bad luck, Skeeter!” Little Bit panted. “I
ain’t know whut kind of nigger bizziness dis is,
but you-alls is got yo’selfs in a jam.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“How you know?” Skeeter quavered.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I answered de telerphome,” Little Bit gasped.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Whut did it say?” Skeeter asked desperately.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It say—it say—de gal at de telerphome orfice
<a id='Page_148'></a>say she listened in when Dazzle phomed to you, an’
dat she has called all de white folks in Tickfall
up an’ tole ’em dat Marse Tom’s house wus being
robbed!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Thereupon Hopey Prophet walked to the electric-light
switch and turned out every light. There
are those who love darkness rather than light because
their deeds are evil.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Listen!” Pap exclaimed tragically. “I kin
hear dem white folks comin’ now!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Indeed, it was not difficult to hear the sound of
running feet. A moment later could be heard
the galloping feet of horses. Then automobile
lights began to whip the darkness as they turned
the corners at high speed and roared like speeding
beasts as they came up the long hill. Then, in the
darkness, a great light fell on Skeeter.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Us niggers oughtn’t to be here when de white
folks come,” he wailed. “Ef dey ketch us in here,
dey’ll put us in jail. Ef dey see us leavin’, dey’ll
shoot us!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Easy, eve’ybody!” Pap Curtain hissed as he
opened the front door. “Git still!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then a low sigh of disappointment escaped from
every throat. The front lawn was all aquiver
with the dark shadows of moving men!</p>

<p class='c005'>“Good-by, fair world!” Figger Bush whimpered.
“Us is caught like a bug in a jug.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Shut up!” Pap Curtain snarled. “Whar kin
we hide?”</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_149'></a>“Git up on de roof!” Skeeter Butts suggested.
“Dar’s a ladder in de attic, an’ we kin climb
through a trap-door to de roof.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Eight negroes went shuffling up the steps toward
the top of the house just as the clatter of feet
sounded upon the porch, and the front door was
pushed open.</p>

<p class='c005'>Four perspiring negroes boosted Hopey up the
ladder, and pushed her capacious form through
the narrow square opening to the roof. Then they
cautiously lowered the door and gratefully seated
themselves upon it.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Safe!” Skeeter exulted. “Us is safe!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Alas! He did not know that the door he was
sitting on had a catch-lock on the inside, and that
he and his friends were on that roof to stay until
rescued!</p>
<h3 class='c010'>III</h3>

<p class='c011'>From their observatory upon the roof, our
friends beheld a mob of men surround the house
and cautiously inspect all the lawn, the outhouses,
and the land surrounding. Half a dozen men
under the direction of Sheriff Flournoy searched
the house, lighting up every room, looking in every
closet, examining every corner, and peering under
every bed.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I reckon the robbers, if any, got away, fellows,”
Flournoy announced as he came out on the front
<a id='Page_150'></a>porch. “We cannot find anybody, and cannot
see that anything has been disturbed.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Where are the niggers who raised the alarm?”
a voice asked.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I guess they hit the grit,” Flournoy smiled.
“I can’t imagine Hopey and Dazzle staying to see
what a burglar wanted, or returning to see what
he got.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Here’s one nigger has showed up!” a voice
responded.</p>

<p class='c005'>“White folks!” Vinegar Atts bawled as he was
pushed into the light through a crowd of men.
“Whut done happened to Marse Tom’s house?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Where have you been?” Flournoy snapped.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Jes’ got back from a chu’ch religious meetin’,”
Vinegar explained. “Marse Tom lef’ me an’
Hopey in charge of dis house, an’ he ain’t gwine
approve his lawn gittin’ trompled up wid white
folks.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Somebody tried to rob this house while you
were away,” Flournoy told him.</p>

<p class='c005'>Vinegar’s eyes opened until they glowed in the
light from the porch like two china door-knobs.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Did you-all good white folks ketch de robber?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Did de robber steal anything?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Whar is Hopey at?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“The robber may have kidnapped her.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You’s prankin’ wid me, Marse John,” Vinegar
<a id='Page_151'></a>howled. “Dar ain’t no one robber could kidnack
Hopey. Dat wus a <i>band</i> of robbers—I surmises
about fawty in de gang.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Vinegar fumbled with his hat, and his breath
came and went in labored gasps.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’m glad de robbers never stole nothin’,” he
sighed. “Dat house am plum’ full of pretty
doodads, an’ ef Marse Tom wus to come home an’
find dem rooms empty, I’d hab to <i>esplain</i> to him.
An’ Marse Tom cain’t onderstand nothin’—when
a nigger esplains.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Vinegar shook his head in great perplexity over
this particular white man’s mental fulness. One
of the mysteries of his life was that he had never
put anything across with Colonel Gaitskill. He
knew the end from the beginning, and all the
ramifications thereof, and with him, Vinegar’s
explanations never explained. They merely caused
complications.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Whut is us gwine do now, Marse John?” he
asked.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’m going to leave you to guard this house
until daylight,” Flournoy told him. “Then I’ll
come and examine it more carefully.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I ain’t got to guard it from de inside, is I,
Marse John?” Vinegar asked in frightened
tones.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes—no, I think you had better stay outside,”
Flournoy replied in a meditative tone. “If you
go inside, you’ll go to sleep. If you stay out, the
<a id='Page_152'></a>weather is ’most too cool to sleep comfortably,
and you will have intervals of wakefulness.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I ain’t gwine sleep wid no band of burglars
trapesin’ aroun’,” Vinegar assured him stoutly.
“But I’ll feel a whole heap safer on de outside.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ll leave an automatic shotgun and two pistols
with you, Vinegar,” Flournoy said. “Now you
sit down by that tree over there and keep watch.
Hear me?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I prefers to stand up an’ keep watch, Marse
John,” Vinegar said as he placed the two pistols in
his pocket and reached out for the gun. “I never
could shoot good settin’ down.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You can’t run good settin’ down, either, can
you?” Flournoy said mockingly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Naw, suh, I cain’t git a real good runnin’
start,” Vinegar chuckled.</p>

<p class='c005'>“If you see anybody, don’t you run—you
shoot!” Flournoy snapped. “But don’t shoot
until we all get off this lot.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dis here powder an’ shot don’t cost me
nothin’,” Vinegar grinned. “I’ll shore shoot—but
I ain’t sayin’ dat I won’t run. My religium
teaches me to exoncise discretion.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Thereupon the crowd, with much joking and
loud laughter, wandered off toward the town.
They assembled in various popular resorts for
liquid refreshment, and then went home for the
night.</p>

<p class='c005'>Vinegar stood under the tree in the silence and
<a id='Page_153'></a>darkness. His first thought was that he would
stand like a watchful sentinel all night long. But
the novelty of standing guard over a silent, unlighted
house soon wore off, especially when, as he
expressed it, “standing up ailed his feets.”</p>

<p class='c005'>He sat down “to rest his feets,” removing his
shoes for greater comfort. He had spent many
years of his life on that hill, and it had always
seemed to be a populous place up to that night.
Now it was lonely and lonesome; nobody to talk
to but himself, a poor listener and an unedifying
conversationalist.</p>

<p class='c005'>Sitting upright “ailed his back.” He shuffled
along the ground on the seat of his trousers until
he felt the trunk of the tree as a support for his
spine. Holding the chilly barrel of his shotgun
“ailed his hands”; sitting upon the two pistols in
his hip pockets “ailed his thighs.” He laid his
weapons aside within easy reach.</p>

<p class='c005'>The ground was warmer than the trunk of the
tree against which he was leaning. It wouldn’t
do for his back to get chilled—he might catch “de
Spanish fluence.” So he placed the spine of his
back level with the earth and permitted the genial
warmth of the soil to permeate his massive frame
from his head to his heels. Lying flat upon the
ground “ailed his head.” He reached for his
shoes, placed them under his head for a pillow,
looked straight up in the sky and counted three
stars—four—seven—fo’teen——</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_154'></a>About that time, eight negroes who had been
crouched in very cramped attitudes on the steep
roof, stood up to ease themselves and seek more
comfortable positions.</p>

<p class='c005'>“How we gwine git word to Vinegar ’thout
gittin’ our fool heads shot off?” Pap Curtain
whispered, looking down into the yard, where he
could see a dark mass under a tree.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Telerphome him,” Little Bit suggested.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Us mought start to sing a religious toon,”
Figger Bush, vocalist, proposed. “Dat’ll ca’m
his mind an’ make him peaceful.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Wid all dem guns on him, we wants him to
favor peace,” Skeeter agreed.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Singin’ on top of de Shoofly Chu’ch mought
ca’m his mind,” Hitch rumbled doubtfully. “But
ef he hears singin’ on top of dis house, it mought
trouble his mind.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Don’t whisper so loud,” Dazzle warned the
men. “Ef de white folks ketch us up on dis roof
dey’ll kill us dead wid guns an’ put us in jail.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“’Twon’t be no worse dan spendin’ de rest of
our lives up on de top shelf of dis house,” Pap Curtain
retorted.</p>

<p class='c005'>“’Tain’t no reason fer us to set up on top of dis
roof,” Hitch Diamond growled. “Us might git
sleepy an’ roll off an’ bu’st ourselfs like a water-millyum.
Less git down through de trap-door
into de attic.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Of co’se, dat’s de idear!” Skeeter applauded.
<a id='Page_155'></a>“Vinegar ain’t guarding but one side of dis house
nohow. Us’ll slip out on de yuther side an’ go
away from here.”</p>

<p class='c005'>He reached for the edge of the door and tried
to lift it. It would not move. The latch on the
other side of that door had held the door in place
through Gulf storms which had snapped trees like
toothpicks.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dis door is heavy, Hitch—git aholt!” Skeeter
panted, straining at his task.</p>

<p class='c005'>Four negro men promptly lent their aid and
lifted, but they did not lift the door.</p>

<p class='c005'>“My lawdymussy!” Hitch Diamond sighed
with sudden enlightenment, as the cold, nervous
sweat popped out on his forehead with the realization
of their predicament. “I knows whut us is
done. Dis dang door is got a ketch-lock on de inside,
an’ us is done locked ourselfs out an’ up on
de roof!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Is you plum’ shore, Hitchie?” Skeeter asked
in a voice that was near to tears.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I knows it,” Hitch whispered. “Marse Tom
sont me up here one time to look fer a leak in de
roof, an’ I locked myse’f out in jes’ dis same way.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“How did you git rescued, Hitchie?” Skeeter
asked tearfully.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I hollered fer he’p till Marse Tom come up an’
onlatched de door from de inside,” Hitch told him.</p>

<p class='c005'>“No fair hollerin’ fer Marse Tom now,” Skeeter
said hopelessly. “We is all dead niggers.”</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_156'></a>“Mebbe ef we wait till day Vinegar will see us
an’ exoncise some sense—” Hopey began.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Shut up, Hopey,” Skeeter interrupted. “Ef
we waits till dat nigger preacher gits sense, us’ll
be here till he dies fer he ain’t never aimin’ todes
no sense. An’ ef he looks up in de dawn’s early
light an’ sees eight kinky heads peepin’ at him
over de edge of dis roof—he’ll shoot, an’ dar’ll be
eight blackbirds bakin’ in a pie!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Lemme go take a peep at Revun Atts now,
befo’ day,” Little Bit said, as he removed his shoes
and began to crawl carefully through the darkness
toward the edge of the roof. He was gone a long
time, and the others waited his return in silence.
At last he crawled back and said:</p>

<p class='c005'>“I b’lieves dat Vinegar is asleep, brudders. It
’pears to me like he’s layin’ down flat, an’ ef you
listens real good I think us kin hear him snore.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dat don’t he’p us none,” Hitch Diamond
grumbled. “Ef anything wakes him up, he’ll be
more skeart dan ever, an’ he’ll beller like a cow.”</p>

<p class='c005'>They sat down on the trap-door and waited a
long time, each one trying to devise some plan
of escape.</p>

<p class='c005'>Finally, in desperation, Skeeter Butts removed
his shoes and crawled to the edge of the roof.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Hello, Revun!” he exclaimed in a low tone.
But Vinegar’s audible breathing was undisturbed
by the birdlike voice.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Hey, elder!” Skeeter hailed, getting louder.
<a id='Page_157'></a>Skeeter frightened himself by the courageous loudness
of his voice, but Vinegar heard nothing to
interrupt his dreams.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ho! Vinegar Atts!” Skeeter barked; and
when he perceived no effect, he howled: “Hey,
you ole fool nigger preacher, wake up! Git up!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Hush, Skeeter!” Mustard Prophet warned
him. “You’re hollerin’ loud enough to wake up
all de white folks in dis town, but it takes a real
whoopful tone to wake a nigger. Don’t fotch all
de white folks up on us.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“How we gwine git dis old fool woked up?”
Skeeter snapped.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Take a brick off de top of de chimney an’ throw
it down at him,” Little Bit suggested.</p>

<p class='c005'>They wrenched off a brick and threw it. It
hit the ground with a loud slap. Vinegar slept on.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I knowed dat would be de come-out,” Hitch
grumbled. “Bricks won’t wake up a nigger onless
dey land on his head!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Whut we gwine do?” Skeeter wailed. “I
never wus as tired roostin’ on a roof in my life.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Nobody answered, and there was silence while
all pondered the problem. The next suggestion
came from Figger Bush.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I read in a book about a man dat escaped out
of jail by tyin’ his clothes togedder an’ makin’ a
rope. Mebbe ef we tear up our clothes an’ make
a rope an’ let Little Bit down to de groun’——”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Who—<i>me?</i>” Little Bit demanded. “Naw!
<a id='Page_158'></a>But I’ll he’p hold de rope while Hitch Diamond
climbs down.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I got de idear, niggers!” Pap Curtain put in.
“Less set somepin on fire an’ throw it down by
de side of Vinegar. Dat’ll wake him up all right,
an’ it’ll gib a good light fer him to see his friends
by.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“How come you didn’t think of dat sooner,
Pap?” Skeeter asked, as he removed his coat and
began to pull off his shirt. “I contributes my
shirt fer de blaze!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Thereupon they tied Skeeter’s shirt into a tight
wad, struck a match, and set fire to it. When the
blaze grew strong, they tossed it over the edge of
the roof.</p>

<p class='c005'>Their aim was good—too good. When Vinegar
waked up he found the lawn glowing with light,
and throwing fantastic shadows upon the sides of
the house—shadows that resembled giant figures,
figures which possessed hoof and wing and beak
and claw and forked tail and leering looks and
sneering mouths, all the malice of deformity. And
he also saw that the rear portion of his swing-tail
preaching coat was on fire!</p>

<p class='c005'>Then he split the silence of the night with a cry
which makes every nerve quiver whenever it is
heard. Vinegar’s voice had been trained for vociferation
by years of exercise in calling for strayed
hogs in the swamp, by preaching to somnolent
negroes to whom his voice must carry through
<a id='Page_159'></a>slumberland, and by camp-meeting singing where
sound took the place of symphony. That cry
was louder than any human voice had ever uttered
in Tickfall:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Fie-ur-r! Fie-ur-r! Fie-ur-r!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Smothering the fire on the tail of his Prince
Albert coat with his hands, Vinegar seized his
automatic shotgun and fired six times in the air.
Then he emptied two automatic pistols into the
circumambient atmosphere, and above all the
roar of his artillery he continued to bellow:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Fie-ur-r! Fie-ur-r! Fie-ur-r!”</p>

<p class='c005'>The night watchman down in the town heard
that cry and pulled a pistol from his pocket, firing
six times in the air. Running into the court-house,
he pulled frantically at the bell-rope, and
the wild clangor of the alarm reverberated through
the empty streets. Then voices answered:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Fie-ur-r! Fie-ur-r! Fie-ur-r!”</p>
<h3 class='c010'>IV</h3>

<p class='c011'>From their high perch on top of the house, the
eight negroes could look down upon the entire
village of Tickfall. Appalled by the unexpected
outcome of their ruse, they were terrified beyond
description as they beheld an entire village suddenly
awake from slumber to most intense excitement
and activity.</p>

<p class='c005'>First, they saw the electric lights flash up in
<a id='Page_160'></a>every house in Tickfall. A moment later a large
shaft of light flared across the darkness as a man
opened a door, stepping out in front with shotgun
or pistol. A moment later a number of quick
flashes of light in front of each house and the sound
of shots. It was thus that each man in the village
sought to arouse his neighbors, the promiscuous
shooting being a fire signal in all Louisiana villages.</p>

<p class='c005'>Far over in the other end of the town the negroes
beheld a great chimney belching glowing sparks
from its top, and then from that station a siren-whistle
sounded its weird screech, telling the
inhabitants of Tickfall that the immense water-pumps
were working and the fire-plugs were
throbbing, waiting for the attachment of the hose.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the center of the town two great lights began
to whip the darkness, and another siren sounded,
indicating that the gasoline fire-engine was leaving
its station for its wild run up the hill to the
Gaitskill home.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then from all parts of the town came the honk
of auto-horns and the racket of cars running with
the muffler open; and the noise of running, shouting
men hurrying to the scene, shooting firearms
in the air; and the rattle of hose wagons and ladder
trucks pulling the steep grade; while on top of the
hill, standing on the Gaitskill lawn, was Vinegar
Atts, negro preacher, Boanerges, son of thunder,
bawling in a voice that would almost wake the dead:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Fie-ur-r! Fie-ur-r! Fie-ur-r!”</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_161'></a>Eight negroes, squatting like monkeys on the
top of Colonel Tom Gaitskill’s house prayed to
die. They didn’t want to live another minute.
They did not think it was worth while. They
were in the helpless predicament of some man who
has inadvertently started some powerful piece of
machinery and does not know how to stop it.
They had certainly started something. What the
townful of fire-fighters would do to them when they
caught them was something they did not care to
think about. They preferred to die. If the
chariot of the Lord would just swing low, there
would be eight eager passengers swinging to the
back step, waiting for the invitation: “Come
up higher!”</p>

<p class='c005'>The fire-engine stopped in front of the house;
the ladder wagons thundered into the horse-lot on
the side of the lawn; the multitude of fire-fighters
came romping over the lawn; the hose was unwound
screechingly and dragged to the nearest
fire-plug.</p>

<p class='c005'>Eight terror-stricken negroes lay flat on their
stomachs on the roof moaning in anguish, pleading
with de good Lawd to come an’ git ’em now,
befo’ de white folks got to ’em fust, while Vinegar
Atts, raving like a maniac, pranced up and down
the lawn, bellowing like a bull of Bashan:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Fie-ur-r! Fie-ur-r! Fie-ur-r!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Where is the fire?” a volunteer fireman
screamed.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_162'></a>Vinegar gesticulated in the general direction of
the Gaitskill homestead and whooped: “Fie-ur-r!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Shut up, you fool!” Sheriff Flournoy whooped,
hitting Vinegar in the middle of the back with
his fist, a blow like the kick of a mule. “Shut up
that noise and show us the fire!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Up to that moment it seemed to Vinegar Atts
that the whole hillside was ablaze. He looked
around with startled eyes. The Gaitskill home
was in total darkness. Not a glow of fire anywhere
that needed the aid of the fire department, for all
the fires were those in the engine, the automobiles,
and the cigarettes and cigars of the men. For
the first time the thing looked to Vinegar like a
false alarm. A number of men gathered around
him, and he became frightened.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Befo’ Gawd, white folks,” he stammered
hoarsely, “dar wus a fire a little while ago, but
I don’t know whar-at it is now. It must hab
went out.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You went to sleep and dreamed it!” Flournoy
snapped angrily.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Naw, suh, I ain’t been asleep at all!” Vinegar
declared. “Of co’se, I napped a little early in de
night, but I cain’t really say I sleeped. An’ I wus
wid awake when de fire bu’st loose. I seen it wid
my own eyes.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What was burning?” Flournoy asked.</p>

<p class='c005'>For a moment Vinegar could not recall. Then
he remembered.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_163'></a>“Why, boss, my own coat-tail wus a burnin’!
Look at it! All de swing-tail part of my Prancin’
Albert coat is ruint—de lef’ hind tail is plum’
burnt off!”</p>

<p class='c005'>One of the men backed Vinegar to where he
could stand in front of an automobile light and
inspected the rear of his preaching coat. Vinegar
was right.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What do you make of it, sheriff?” someone
asked.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Aw, I don’t know,” Flournoy said with disgust.
“You can’t get any sense out of this old fool.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’s tellin’ all I knows, Marse John,” Vinegar
said defensively. “Ef dar warn’t no fire, how
come my coat-tail is burnt off?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You may have burnt your coat-tail off three
days ago, for all I know,” Flournoy remarked.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Naw, suh; dis coat-tail smells of fresh fire,
Marse John,” Vinegar protested. “Ef you don’t
b’lieve me, smell it yo’se’f!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You listen to me, Vinegar Atts,” Flournoy said
angrily. “I’m going to search this house and these
premises for a fire, and if I don’t find one I’m going
to kick that burnt coat-tail of yours clear down
the hill to the jail, and I’ll put you in there for forty
years for disturbing the peace! Understand?”</p>

<p class='c005'>He turned and walked to the house, stopping
on the porch.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Listen to me, everybody!” his authoritative
voice commanded. “I am going to search this
<a id='Page_164'></a>house for fire. You men search all the stables
and outhouses.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Vinegar’s hand reached back gingerly in the
vicinity of his coat-tail. That portion of his
anatomy was a particularly soft and tender spot
on him. He decided not to wait for the sheriff
to escort him to jail on the toe of his official boot.
Marse John could be powerful rough with cullud
folks if he wanted to be, and now he appeared to
be mad about something. Vinegar started down
the hill toward the jail on his own volition; he
went straight to the jail, but he didn’t stop there.
He went on, and he kept going three days.</p>

<p class='c005'>Eight negroes had heard the sheriff’s announcement
that he was going to search the house, and
they crouched upon the roof with terror and
despair in their hearts. They knew the white man
would look for fire on the roof!</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dar ain’t no hope now, niggers,” Pap Curtain
moaned. “Us mought as well jump off dis roof
on our heads.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Mebbe Marse John won’t come up on dis
roof,” Little Bit remarked hopefully.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dat white man don’t never leave nothin’ ondone,
Little Bit,” Skeeter sighed mournfully.
“He’ll be up on dis roof jes’ as shore as dar is a top
to dis ole house.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yep, he’s comin’,” Hitch Diamond rumbled.
“I wish I wus de tail of a buzzard—I’d hab some
chance to fly off from here.”</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_165'></a>“Be still, folks; be still an’ lemme think!”
Skeeter Butts exclaimed, seating himself on the
trap-door and clawing at his head with both hands.
“Mebbe I kin pull somepin off!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I wish somepin would pull me offen dis roof!”
Mustard retorted.</p>

<p class='c005'>While the search continued in the yard below,
Skeeter sat and thought. Not a place where a
spark of fire might linger was left uninspected in
the yard, the outhouses, or the corners of the
fence. Within the house, Flournoy was just as
particular and minute in his search. First the
entire lower floor was subjected to the closest inspection.
Then he moved up the steps and
searched in every room and closet. Then he
moved up a third flight of steps, and stood looking
at the contents of the attic, the accumulation of
cast-off stuff of years, sniffing for the odor of
smoke, glaring in the darkness for the smallest
gleam of fire.</p>

<p class='c005'>He knew that house through associations which
carried him back to his earliest childhood. With
his electric flash-light he found the ladder in the
attic which led up to the roof. He remembered
climbing that ladder, or a ladder like that, fifty
years before for a boyish view of the world from
that high point.</p>

<p class='c005'>Slowly he climbed upward until his groping
hands touched the trap-door above his head.</p>

<p class='c005'>Skeeter Butts suddenly rose from his seat upon
<a id='Page_166'></a>the trap-door, belled his hands around his mouth,
and said in a loud whisper:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Lay down flat on de roof, niggers, an’ say yo’
prayers! Lay down an’ be still ef you wants to
save you lives!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then the trap-door was slowly raised about a
foot. Skeeter stepped upon the door with his
full weight and mashed it back into its place.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Who is up on that roof?” Flournoy asked in a
voice which cracked like a pistol shot.</p>

<p class='c005'>“By gosh, Marse John!” Skeeter squalled.
“You mighty nigh skeart de gizzard out of
me. I thought a ha’nt was tryin’ to lift dat
door!”</p>

<p class='c005'>At the sound of Skeeter’s voice Flournoy
laughed. In the many years that Skeeter had
been his “pet nigger,” his “favorite insect,”
Flournoy had found him in so many unexpected
places that he had ceased to be surprised.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What are you doing up on this roof?” Flournoy
asked, pushing up the trap-door and looking at
Skeeter’s outline in the dark.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I climbed up to look fer fire on de roof, Marse
John,” Skeeter said, artfully blocking the door
with his foot so that the sheriff could not easily
raise it higher. “Dis roof is powerful slick, Marse
John. You better not climb out. Dar ain’t no
fire up here nohow!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Come on then; let’s go down,” the sheriff answered,
backing down the ladder.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_167'></a>Skeeter followed willingly, latching the trap-door
securely behind him as he descended.</p>

<p class='c005'>At the foot of the ladder, the sheriff turned his
flash-light into Skeeter’s face.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Where’s your shirt, Skeeter?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I didn’t take no time to put on no shirt, Marse
John,” Skeeter chuckled. “When I heard de
kunnel’s house wus on fire, I jes’ nachelly abandoned
all de clothes I didn’t need.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That was right,” Flournoy approved. “You’re
a white nigger!”</p>
<h3 class='c010'>V</h3>

<p class='c011'>By the time Flournoy and Skeeter had reached
the ground, the volunteer firemen had grown
weary and gone home. The engines, hose-wagon,
ladder-trucks, automobiles, all had gone home.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ll leave you here for the rest of the night,
Skeeter,” Flournoy remarked as he turned his
flash upon his watch to see the time. “I think
Vinegar Atts must have delirium tremens, or
something like that.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“He didn’t git ’em at de Hen-Scratch, Marse
John,” Skeeter said earnestly. “He buys all his
drinks on credick, an’ I holds him down till he’s
mighty nigh teetotal prohibitionist.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You mean that you are the prohibitionist and
he is of necessity the almost total abstainer.”</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_168'></a>“Yes, suh, it’s jes’ as much dat way as it is de
way I said it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Half an hour later Skeeter sneaked up the steps,
unlatched the trap-door, and pushed it open.
Seven negroes were standing with anxious faces
at the opening, and they welcomed Skeeter with
exclamations of thanksgiving which sounded like
a Shoofly prayer and praise service.</p>

<p class='c005'>One by one they climbed down the ladder, then
marched in single file to the kitchen.</p>

<p class='c005'>Skeeter switched on the electric light, and the
eight idiots stood about in dejected attitudes,
sleepy, winking at the light, worn with excitement
and fatigue, depressed by their frightful experiences.</p>

<p class='c005'>Pap Curtain was a man of age and discretion;
he had had various legal experiences which had
put a special emphasis for him upon the motto:
“Safety First.”</p>

<p class='c005'>He looked his seven companions in evil over
very searchingly, then turned to them with these
words:</p>

<p class='c005'>“You niggers cross yo’ heart an’ body!”</p>

<p class='c005'>They made the sign.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Repeat dese here words after me,” Pap snarled.
Then the words came in short phrases, easy to repeat:
“I solemnly swears on de Bible an’ all de
opossums dat I won’t say nothin’ about de doin’s
of dis night, now an’ ferever, amen. An’ ef I does,
I hopes I may die!”</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_169'></a>“An’ ef anybody blabs, I’ll be de nigger dat’ll
cause yo’ onhappy end!” Pap warned them menacingly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Suppose de white folks ax questions?” Little
Bit inquired.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dat’s easy,” Pap replied with a sneering grin.
“Tell eve’ybody dat axes you dat all us niggers
thinks Marse Tom Gaitskill ole house is ha’nted.
Dat’ll be aplenty to say to white folks.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Dazzle Zenor walked over and put her arms
around Skeeter Butts.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You is a brave cullud man, Skeeter,” she told
him. “I loves you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Skeeter disengaged her arms and pushed her
away.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Wus you lyin’ to me when you telerphomed
dat robbers wus in dis house?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Naw, suh, I wus jokin’. I wanted to see wus
you brave enough to come an’ rescue me—an’
you wus, Skeeter, an’ I loves you mo’ dan ever.”</p>

<p class='c005'>But Skeeter evaded her outstretched arms as
she advanced again for a clinch, and with a contemptuous
wave of his yellow hand he delivered
this good-night message:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Git away! You done made me burn up a
shirt an’ waste a good night’s sleep. Dat’s plum’
plenty fer you! I’m always a brave nigger!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then eight negroes uttered a low moan of fright.
The electric light had gone out, leaving them in
darkness in that haunted house!</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_170'></a>The electric lights went out every night at one
o’clock, but they didn’t think of that.</p>

<p class='c005'>Eight negroes left that kitchen in a hurry. They
sped away in eight different directions, at various
speeds, each according to his capability. But
everyone did his best, each chased by a “ha’nt”—for
thus doth conscience make cowards of us all.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Skeeter, kin you rickoleck in your mind about
a nigger man who called hisse’f Wash Jones?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Suttinly,” Skeeter answered. “He snuck in
here about a year ago an’ tried to refawm Tickfall
cullud sawciety. Us made him Fust Grand Organizer
of de Nights of Darkness Lodge fer de
whole worl’ an’ sont him out of town on his fust
gran’ organize. Ain’t seed him since dat time.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“He’s done snuck in agin,” Figger informed him.
“He’s all here—de same flossy vest an’ de same
big watch-chain ’thout no watch to it, an’ de same
mouthful of chawin’ terbacker. But his mouth is
done changed.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Whut done happened to his mouth?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“He’s growed two long mustaches whut comes
down de sides of his nose plum’ below his chin. He
looks like a nigger whut had swallowed two cat-squirrels
an’ lef’ deir tails hangin’ out!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Whut you reckin he done dat fer?” Skeeter
asked.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_172'></a>“Done disguised hisse’f.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“He ain’t refawmin’ nothin’, is he?” Skeeter
asked uneasily.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Naw, suh. He’s organizin’. He done throwed
up his Nights of Darkness Lodge job an’ is cornductin’
health resorts fer cullud pussons.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dar ain’t no sick niggers in Tickfall,” Skeeter
said with relief. “He’s done busted in bizziness
an’ don’t know it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dar ain’t no real sick niggers,” Figger agreed.
“But plenty of us feels jes’ tol’able an’ b’lieves
dat we needs a rest.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Restin’ time an’ Sunday comes nachel wid
niggers,” Skeeter grinned. “You ain’t sweeped
out dis saloon fer about six mont’s.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Cain’t sweep her out now, Skeeter,” Figger
replied hastily. “Fer a fack, I done come to ax
you fer a lay-off fer about two weeks. I needs a
change.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Wharabouts you gwine change to?” Skeeter
asked grouchily.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Out to de ole tabernacle an’ de prize-fight,
picnic, baseball-groun’s, whar Brudder Wash is
organizin’ his health resort.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“How come I ain’t heerd tell ’bout dat?”
Skeeter asked.</p>

<p class='c005'>“He’s been keepin’ it sly because he wus skeart
somebody else would think it up an’ beat him to
it,” Figger explained. “He done leased de ole
camp-groun’s complete, fixed up all de little shacks
<a id='Page_173'></a>whar niggers kin stay, hired Shin Bone to run de
resteraw, made a dancin’-floor in de ole tabernacle,
rented a brass band, an’ is gittin’ ready to rake in
de dollars.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“My Lawd!” Skeeter exclaimed in dismay.
“I been livin’ in dis town all my days an’ I never
thunk of dat gorgeous idear in my whole life.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It shore is a dandy notion,” Figger said with
admiration. “Dar’s fo’ springs of water, a great
big lake to fish an’ swim in, plenty woods an’ play-groun’s.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Gosh! Jes’ think of de money dat’s gwine
miss my pants’ pocket,” Skeeter sighed.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Wash specifies dat dar is a Cooney Island in
New Yawk an’ he’s gwine hab a Coon Island in
Tickfall.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dat shore is put somepin over on me,” Skeeter
mourned.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ef you ain’t got no real good objections, I goes
out dar to-night an’ stays a week,” Figger
remarked.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I don’t like de notion of keepin’ dis saloon
while you gallivants off to a nigger frolic,” Skeeter
protested.</p>

<p class='c005'>“But I gotter go,” Figger assured him.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Nobody ain’t gotter go no place onless he
wants to, excusin’ jail,” Skeeter grumbled.</p>

<p class='c005'>Figger Bush ended the argument by rising from
the table, knocking the ashes from his pipe, and
retiring to a little room in the rear of the bar to
<a id='Page_174'></a>dress. Ten minutes later he came out with a new
suit of clothes, a sunburst tie, a high collar and
most expansive cuffs, and all the other paraphernalia
of a dead-game sport out for a vacation.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I hates to leave you, Skeeter,” Figger remarked
apologetically. “I’s sorry you is got a grouch.
But ef I don’t show up at de tabernacle my grandpaw
won’t like it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“How come you is so suddent oneasy about displeasin’
Popsy Spout?” Skeeter wanted to know.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dat ole man is got money in de bank. Some
day he’s gwine haul off an’ die. When he do, he’ll
inherit me his house an’ all his cash spondulix.
Atter dat happens, I’ll buy one-half of dis Hen-Scratch
saloon.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dat ole gizzard says he’s gwine live till he’s one
hundred year ole,” Skeeter reminded him.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dat means you got to wait thirty year fer yo’
money.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Mebbe he’s done miscalculated ’bout how
long he’s gwine hang on de bush,” Figger grinned.
“I been pussuadin’ him to take a little swim in de
Cooley Lake eve’y atternoon when we gits out dar,
an’ you know dar’s allergaters in dat lake whut
kin swaller Joner an’ de whale.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ef a allergater swallered Popsy, he’d treat him
jes’ like de whale done Joner—he’d git dat nigger
off his stomick as soon as he could,” Skeeter
growled.</p>

<p class='c005'>“’Tain’t so, Skeeter,” Figger argued earnestly.
<a id='Page_175'></a>“When one of dese here Loozanny allergaters
swallers a nigger, he crawls out on a mud-bank an’
goes to sleep an’ fergits all about dat cullud pusson
in his midst.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ef I could git my wish, I’d be glad if one dem
things would chaw up you an’ Popsy, too,” Skeeter
retorted.</p>

<p class='c005'>Figger sat down and lighted a cigarette, wondering
how he could placate Skeeter for leaving
him alone with the saloon. He could think of
nothing else to say, so he changed the theme a
little:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Whut bothers my mind a little, Skeeter, is de
fack dat Popsy ain’t got no real good notion whut
kind of doin’s will be at de tabernacle. He remembers
how ’twus befo’ de war when de white
folks helt religium-meetin’s out dar. He wants
me to go an’ attend de religium services so me an’
Scootie will git gooder dan we are.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Skeeter brightened up and laughed.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dat means de joke is on you an’ Scootie, Figger,”
he guffawed. “I’d druther hab de seben-year
itch wid nothin’ to scratch wid—I’d druther
be a drag-log tied to a houn’-dawg—dan listen to
dat ole Popsy fussin’ ’bout how good things useter
wus an’ how much wusser things is now. Go to it,
Figger! You got my permission fer a week’s
leave-off.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I been tellin’ you I warn’t so awful anxious to
go,” Figger reminded him.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_176'></a>“You ain’t ’pressed dat fack on my mind very
hard,” Skeeter replied. “I wants you to come in
eve’y mawnin’ an’ barkeep. You kin go out an’
enjoy Popsy at night.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ll be in to-morrer mawnin’ early,” Figger
answered, as he left.</p>

<p class='c005'>But Figger did not appear in the saloon until
the next day at noon. Skeeter had spent the time
thinking up some especially cutting things to say
to his partner, but Figger entered the place like a
personified calamity and Skeeter forgot all his unkind
words in an intense curiosity to know what
had happened.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I done run up on somepin awful bad, Skeeter,”
Figger groaned. “Pap Curtain is fixin’ to start a
saloon.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“My Lawd!” Skeeter exclaimed. “De Hen-Scratch
has been de onliest cullud saloon in Tickfall
fer twenty year. Now dis here Pap Curtain
is aimin’ to rival us out of bizzness.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dat’s de way de rabbit p’ints his nose,” Figger
assured him.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Whar do he git de money?” Skeeter asked.</p>

<p class='c005'>“He’s makin’ arrangements to marrify it,” Figger
wailed. “Dar’s a great big ole cow of a woman
out dar whut owns five hundred dollars. Her
paw an’ maw is talkin’ it aroun’ an’ dey’s huntin’
somebody dat’ll marry her fer her money.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Is she as bad lookin’ as all dat?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Shore is. She looks like a puddin’ dat riz too
<a id='Page_177'></a>high an’ spreads out too much. She kinder comes
outen her clothes an’ rolls over de edges of a chair
an’ de big of her ’pears like it’s boilin’ over all de
sides all de time.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I ketch on,” Skeeter grinned. “She jes’ out-niggers
herse’f by bein’ so fat.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Pap’ll take her ef he kin git her,” Figger
sighed. “He ain’t pertickler. He wants money
to start a saloon.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Us’ll bofe close up dis saloon to-night an’ go
out an’ take a look on,” Skeeter announced. “Dis
town kin do without two nigger saloons. One
is a plum’ plenty. Who is dis here nigger woman
anyhow?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“She’s ole Isaiah Gaitskill’s stepchile,” Figger
informed him. “She takes atter her maw in fat-hood.
She’s a widder woman an’ her deceasted
husbunt left her a lot of insurance dollars.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Gosh!” Skeeter sighed in desperation. “Pap
Curtain an’ a widder woman! Two ag’in’ one—I
ain’t got no show. Life ain’t fitten to live no more.”</p>
<h3 class='c010'>II<br /> <br />PLEASURE AND PROFIT</h3>

<p class='c011'>In the evening Skeeter Butts followed Figger
out to the old tabernacle grounds and was amazed
at the transformation of the place.</p>

<p class='c005'>Wash Jones had moved many of the benches out
<a id='Page_178'></a>of the building and had placed them under trees
and in the groves. He had made sawdust trails
from the tabernacle to the edge of the lake, to the
Shin Bone eating-house, and to all other places
where a little money could be coaxed from the
pocket of the pleasure-seeker.</p>

<p class='c005'>He had made a dancing-floor in a part of the
tabernacle, arranging seats around it for the sightseers.
He had erected refreshment-booths in other
portions of the building, and also a band-stand,
where the sweating, hard-worked black Tickfall
brass band was having the most hilarious time of
their lives.</p>

<p class='c005'>Negroes had come in from the plantations for
miles around. Horses were tied to all the trees,
wagons and buggies were sheltered in the woods,
and a great mob of folks moved up and down the
sawdust avenues or tramped the woods, shouting,
laughing, cutting monkey-shines, and eating popcorn
balls, hot dogs, and sandwiches made of fried
catfish.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was a noisy, boisterous, rollicking place which
Skeeter entered.</p>

<p class='c005'>Ordinarily Skeeter would have been the center
of the whole thing. But this affair had slipped
up on him and had suddenly developed business
complications and his mind was too occupied
with his troubles to enjoy the fun going on around
him.</p>

<p class='c005'>Soon after entering the grounds he found Pap
<a id='Page_179'></a>Curtain. Pap was entertaining himself by paying
five cents for three baseballs. He would then
try to throw each ball so it would stay in a bucket
about twenty feet away. Whenever he placed one
to stay, the proprietor of the amusement feature
would give Pap a cigar. The cigars sold three for
a nickel in Tickfall and as Pap never succeeded
in placing more than two balls in the bucket, the
proprietor of the place always made a fair profit
in the transaction. Pap had his pocket stuffed
full of cheap cigars and promptly offered a handful
to Skeeter.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I don’t smoke garbage,” Skeeter said impatiently,
waving aside the offer.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I figger I done acquired enough of dese cabbage-leaves.
Less move on an’ git some fun somewhere
else.”</p>

<p class='c005'>A short distance down the sawdust trail they
ran into something new. The diminutive darky
named Little Bit was standing on a frail platform
erected over a hogshead full of water. There was
a trigger shaped like a skiff-paddle about fifty feet
away, and men were throwing baseballs at this
paddle. If someone hit the trigger, the platform,
on which Little Bit was standing, fell and ducked
the diminutive darky in the hogshead of water.
Little Bit was well known in Tickfall and this
particular attraction was a riot. Sometimes thirty
baseballs would be flying toward that paddle-shaped
trigger at one time, and the hapless Little
<a id='Page_180'></a>Bit spent more time in the hogshead of water than
he did on the platform.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Lawd, Skeeter!” Pap exclaimed when he had
laughed himself nearly to exhaustion. “I’d
druther be de owner of dis Coon Island dan de’
pres’dunt of de Europe war. I feels like I’s jes’
nachelly cut out fer a job like dis. I been huntin’
fer somepin I been fitten fer all my life an’
dis am it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I wish you had dis job, Pap,” Skeeter replied.
“I stopped by to ax you a question.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ll answer yes or no, like de gram jury always
tells me to do,” Pap grinned.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Word is done been sont to me dat you is fixin’
to start a saloon. Is dat so?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yep.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Whar you gwine git de money at?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“A fat widder woman’s husbunt is kicked de
bucket an’ lef’ her a wad of dough,” Pap chuckled.
“I’s gwine marrify de widder, mix dat dough
wid my brains an’ start me a place of bizzness.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I thought you wus done through wid marrin’
womens,” Skeeter wailed. “You done been
kotched fo’ times already.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yas, suh, but in all dem fo’ times I never married
no widder. My edgycation is been neglected.
Dey wus all young an’ foolish gals. Dis here is a
sottled woman—so dang fat dat when she sottles
down it takes a block an’ tackle to h’ist her
agin.”</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_181'></a>“Aw, shuckins!” Skeeter exclaimed. “Whut
you marryin’ dat kind of gal fer?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Fer five hundred dollars!” Pap said.</p>

<p class='c005'>Skeeter turned away with a troubled face. Pap
looked after him a moment, then purchased three
more baseballs to throw at the trigger-paddle.</p>

<p class='c005'>At the far end of the grounds, Skeeter found
Wash Jones.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Wash,” he said after a little conversation, “I
understands dat you is got a prize widder in dis
show.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The big black eyed Skeeter for a moment with
suspicion. He took the time to help himself to a
big chew of tobacco before he answered, watching
Skeeter covertly all the time. At last he said:</p>

<p class='c005'>“I ain’t heerd tell about dat. But I ain’t supprized
none. I got all de attrackshuns on dis
Coon Island whut is.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dey tells me dis widder is got a dead husbunt
an’ five hundred dollars,” Skeeter continued.</p>

<p class='c005'>Wash dropped his plug of tobacco and stooped
to pick it up. That Skeeter had this information
was not a surprise to him; it was a shock.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Who mought dat widder be?” Wash asked.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Sister Solly Skaggs,” Skeeter informed him.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I knows her,” Wash groaned. “Fat—O Lawd!
Ef dat gal wuster drap dead, dey’d hab to git a
mud-scow outen de river fer a coffin, an’ de only
hole in de groun’ big enough to put her in is Marse
Tom’s sand pit. Dat five hundred dollars don’t
<a id='Page_182'></a>int’rust my mind, naw, suh, not at all, not at all!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Don’t waste no time thinkin’ about it,”
Skeeter sighed. “Pap Curtain is done spoke fer
it—de fat’s in de fire.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Which?” Wash Jones exclaimed in a tone that
popped like a gun. “Pap Curtain?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Pap done pulled de curtain down on de widder,”
Skeeter assured him. “Nobody else needn’t
look at her charms.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Wash Jones turned around three times, as if
looking for some place to go and practically undecided
about what direction to choose.</p>

<p class='c005'>Skeeter wandered on disconsolately and finally
found himself beside the old tabernacle. An aged
man approached him. Skeeter looked for a place
to escape, but found no avenue of exit and stood
his ground. The venerable man was Popsy Spout.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I don’t ketch on ’bout dis, Skeeter,” he said in
the high, shrill complaining voice of senility. “Dis
here ain’t de place whut I thought it wus. ’Tain’t
de same place whut it uster be befo’ an’ endurin’
of de war. When do de religium exoncises begin?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I dunno,” Skeeter answered. “Ax Wash
Jones.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I axed him. Wash said ef de people wanted
religium doin’s dey could start ’em deyselfs,”
Popsy whined. “Wash said he wus jes’ de servunt
of de people fer so much money per each people.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dat’s right,” Skeeter laughed.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I thought dey wus gwine hab preachin’ in dat
<a id='Page_183'></a>ole tabernacle to-night,” Pap complained. “Instid
of dat, dey’s gwine had a dance fer a prize! Yas,
suh—whut do Gawd think of dat? A dance fer
a prize?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I hopes dat Pap Curtain slips up an’ breaks
bofe behime legs,” Skeeter remarked bitterly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“’Tain’t no use hopin’,” the old man chuckled.
“Pap is like me—spry on his legs fer a ole man.
But Pap an’ me don’t favor dancin’. We been
talkin’ it over. I deespise a nigger dat dances.
Ef any of my kin-folks cuts a shuffle on dat flo’ dis
night, dey ain’t no kinnery of mine no more.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I ’speck I better go gib Figger a warnin’ right
now,” Skeeter exclaimed eagerly, glad to find a
reason for departure.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dat’s right!” Popsy exclaimed, in his high,
cracked falsetto. “You warn him good!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Skeeter wandered down to the shore of the little
lake and sat down alone to think out some method
of defeating Pap’s designs. After an hour Figger
Bush found him by the glow of his cigarette, and
came and sat beside him.</p>

<p class='c005'>“De only way to bust Pap’s plans, Figger, is to
marry dat fat Solly Skaggs to somebody else.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Who’ll take her?” Figger inquired.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It’ll hab to be somebody dat ain’t married
already,” Skeeter said.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You’s de only onmarried man I knows, excusin’
Pap,” Figger giggled. “I guess you’ll hab to
make de riffle.”</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_184'></a>Skeeter considered this a moment in silence.
Then he asked:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Is she so awful fat as people says she is?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ain’t you never seed her?” Figger exclaimed.
“Honey, de half ain’t never yit been told! She’s
been reg’lar to her meals ever since she wus borned,
an’ her meals is been frequent an’ copious, an’ her
vittles is agreed wid her too well! Come on,
Skeeter, lemme interjuice you to yo’ future wife!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Figger rose to his feet with eagerness. Skeeter
shook his head and sighed.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I wouldn’t choose any, Figger. I’d druther
Pap Curtain would rival me out of bizzness.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Mebbe we could wish her onto somebody else,”
Figger proposed.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I been tryin’ to think up some onmarried man,”
Skeeter told him, “but I don’t see none in sight.”</p>

<p class='c005'>They smoked for an hour longer without producing
a spark of an idea. At last Skeeter said:</p>

<p class='c005'>“All I kin do jes’ now, Figger, is to keep Pap
away from dat gal ontil I finds a fitten secont husbunt
fer her. Dar’s gwine be a prize-dance to-night
an’ I nominates you to dance wid Sister
Solly Skaggs.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ef she trods on me I’ll be a squashed worm of
de dust,” Figger wailed.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Don’t talk back,” Skeeter replied sharply.
“I’ll fix it so you an’ Sister Solly win de prize.”</p>
<div>
  <a id='Page_185'></a>
  <h3 class='c010'>III<br /> <br />“DAT FAT, FLOUNDERIN’ FOOL”</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Solly Skaggs was a widow of the sod variety
and had enjoyed her matrimonial release for about
six months. She had not mourned too much for
Solly nor had she loved him much. For he was
about as lovable as a sick dog and his departure
from the world was a distinct blessing to all the
inhabitants thereof.</p>

<p class='c005'>Old Isaiah Gaitskill, in discussing her chances
for matrimony again, assured her that no negro
would marry her because she was too fat. But
this did not discourage the lady and there was no
indication of despair either in her manner or her
deportment, for she dressed and acted like a miss
of sweet sixteen.</p>

<p class='c005'>Old Popsy Spout stood on the edge of the throng
and watched her elephantine performances on the
dancing-floor. Growing weary, he walked over
and sat down upon a bench beside Pap Curtain.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Look at dat fool nigger gal, Pap,” he whined.
“I been livin’ off and on nigh onto one hundred
year an’ I done seen plenty sights, but dat fat
fool flounderin’ on dat floor is de wust sight till
yit.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Don’t preach so loud, Popsy,” Pap said with
a warning hiss. “You mought hurt dat cullud
lady’s feelin’s.”</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_186'></a>“I ain’t preachin’,” Popsy snapped. “I’s tellin’
facks. Excusin’ dat, she ain’t got no feelin’s. Her
feelin’s is padded two-foot deep in fat. I bet she’s
got some age on her, too.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not too much age fer a widder,” Pap said.
“An’ she’s wuth consid’able money since her fust
husbunt up an’ died on her. Five hundred dollars
will keep dat woman fat fer a long time.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why don’t you git in de race, Pap?” Popsy
suggested. “You ain’t got no wife now.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dat’s my bizzness right now,” Pap grinned.
“I needs a little cash money to start a saloon.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You ain’t figgerin’ to buy out Figger an’
Skeeter in de Hen-Scratch, is you?” Popsy asked.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Naw, suh, I’s fixin’ to run ’em out,” Pap said
confidently, as he arose and walked away.</p>

<p class='c005'>Popsy arose, too, pushed his way through the
crowd and went in search of Figger Bush. He
found Figger and his wife and Skeeter Butts in the
Shin Bone eating-house. He hastened to their
table, rested his rusty stove-pipe hat upon the top
of the table and sat down.</p>

<p class='c005'>“How come you an’ Skeeter is bofe lef’ yo’ bizzness
to come out here, Figger?” he inquired.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dar ain’t no bizzness wid dis frolic gwine on,”
Figger said.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You better git to wuckin’ up some new bizzness,”
the old man remarked. “Pap Curtain is
jes’ tole me he wus gwine run you-alls out.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“We been talkin’ about dat,” Skeeter broke in.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_187'></a>“Pap’s tryin’ to pick a widder an’ us is wonderin’
how we kin bump him off de job.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’s gittin’ to be a awful ole fool,” Popsy sighed.
“I jes’ dis minute suggested to Pap dat he ought
to marry dat widder an’ git her out of her misery
an’ her mournin’.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Whut you mean by doin’ dat, Popsy?”
Skeeter snapped. “You done ruint us. I’s thinkin’
about firin’ Figger now because our bizzness is
got so bum wid prohibition an’ all dem yuther
troubles.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Mebbe I could go back an’ tell Pap he is makin’
a miscue at his age,” Popsy proposed.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You better go do somepin,” Skeeter snapped.
“You go potterin’ aroun’ an’ spile my trade an’
I’ll kick Figger out an’ you’ll hab dis here wuthless
nigger to suppote.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not ef I kin he’p it,” Popsy said positively.
“I’ll shore git busy an’ c’reck dat mistake. I
needs my dollars fer my own use. I’s fixin’ to
spend ’em in my ole age, when I gits ole.”</p>

<p class='c005'>At this moment Wash Jones stepped to the middle
of the floor, pulled proudly at one of his squirrel-tail
mustaches, knocked upon a dining-table
with the nicked edge of a thick, granite saucer,
and commanded silence.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I announces dar will be a prize-dance at de
tabernacle to-night. It will be de last dance of de
evenin’. Five cents lets you into de tabernacle
to perceive de dancers, ten cents will gib you de
<a id='Page_188'></a>right to dance. At de end of de last dance a prize
will be gib away to de lucky winner. De show
begins at ten o’clock.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’s reckin I’ll hab to trod ’em a few,” Skeeter
sighed. “Got to do somepin to ease up my mind.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I don’t allow Scootie an’ Figger to dance,”
Popsy snapped. “’Tain’t decent an’ religium to
cut monkey-shines like dat at a camp-meetin’.
Married folks oughter sottle down an’ behave.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I agree wid you,” Skeeter grinned, winking
at Figger Bush. “Bofe of ’em is gittin’ too ole
an’ stiff to dance an’ Figger never wus no account
dancer nohow. As fer Scootie, she dances like one
dese here Teddy bears.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“’Tain’t so,” Scootie snapped. “You gimme a
couple dances wid you to-night an’ I’ll show you—<i>ouch</i>!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Figger kicked Scootie under the table and
pounded on the top of the table with his fist to
drown her voice, looking fearfully the while at
Popsy Spout to see if he was listening to her remarks.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Shut up!” he hissed. “Whut you want to be
such a splatter-jaw fer? Watch whut you’s sayin’!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Scootie cast a frightened look at Popsy, but the
old man showed by his next question that he had
not noticed her break.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Whut kind prizes does dey gib fer de dance,
Skeeter?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Nobody ain’t know but Wash Jones,” Skeeter
<a id='Page_189'></a>informed him. “Dis is de fust night of de show
an’ no prizes ain’t git bestowed yit.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“’Twon’t be nothin’ but a pack of chawgum fer
de lady an’ a box of cigareets fer de man,” Figger
said disgustedly. “Wash Jones ain’t gwine gib
nothin’ away. I think I’ll cut out de dance an’
go to bed.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Me, too,” Popsy whined. “I got a little bed
out here in one of dese shacks ef I could find it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It’s down by de lake, Popsy,” Figger told him,
glad that Popsy was leaving them. “You won’t
hab no trouble gittin’ dar.”</p>

<p class='c005'>As soon as Popsy had departed, Scootie turned
to Figger and snapped:</p>

<p class='c005'>“You mighty nigh kicked my leg off an’ ole
Popsy didn’t pay no mind to whut I wus sayin’
at all.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Stop talkin’ ’bout dancin’ whar Popsy is,”
Figger growled. “Dat ole man will git mad an’
gib all his money to furin missionaries when he
dies.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You’s makin’ yo’se’f tired fer nothin’, Figger,”
Skeeter giggled. “Popsy will find out about yo’
dancin’ powerful soon.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“How soon?” Figger asked.</p>

<p class='c005'>“As soon as you an’ Sister Skaggs wins dem
prizes to-night.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I ain’t gwine win no prize. Dar cain’t be no
prize-dancin’ wid dat fat ole cow. De judges
would laugh at us.”</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_190'></a>“I’ll fix de judges,” Skeeter laughed. “Leave
it wid me an’ Wash Jones.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You ain’t fixin’ to buy up de judges, is you?”
Figger asked.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Naw. I’s fixin’ to buy Wash Jones. ’Twon’t
cost much. Wash is a cheap nigger.”</p>
<h3 class='c010'>IV<br /> <br />THE JOYOUS TROUBLE-MAKERS</h3>

<p class='c011'>Wash Jones was standing behind the tabernacle,
mopping the copious perspiration that streamed
from his baboon face.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I finds dis here bizzness a heap more wuck dan
I bargained fer,” he complained to Skeeter Butts.
“When I fust started out I thought dat niggers
would jes’ entertain deyselfs an’ not expeck nothin’
from me but de pleasure of my comp’ny. But I
finds dat dey expecks me to be on de job of waitin’
on ’em all de time.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Suttinly,” Skeeter snickered. “Ef I charged
admissions to my saloon I wouldn’t allow no niggers
to wait on demselfs. I’d hab to serve ’em.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I done collected all de admission-fares I expecks
to git,” Wash sighed, fanning himself with
his big hat. “As fer as I’m concerned, dis here
show kin end right now.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ef you end her up now de people will kick
an’ want deir money back,” Skeeter reminded
<a id='Page_191'></a>him. “You done collected up fer a week in
eegsvance.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’d be powerful glad to turn de job over to
some yuther feller fer whut he kin make out of it,
ef I had a good excuse fer hittin’ de grit out of
here,” Wash suggested.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I ain’t candidatin’ fer de place,” Skeeter
chuckled. “But I kin show you how you kin
make a few more easy dollars ef you ain’t keer too
much how you got ’em.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Spill de beans right here, Skeeter,” Wash answered
earnestly. “Dat sounds good to me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“My trouble am dis,” Skeeter began. “You
is givin’ a prize-dance to-night an’ I wants to pick
de winner.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ll app’int you one of de judges fer one dollar,”
Wash said promptly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dat won’t he’p none,” Skeeter said. “Dat’ll
jes’ git one vote.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ll be a judge myse’f an’ dat’ll gib you two
votes—dat is, ef you is willin’ to bestow anodder
dollar fer my vote.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Who will de yuther judge be?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ef you gib me anodder dollar I’ll let you name
him yo’se’f,” Wash replied without hesitation.
“Pick yo’ own nigger an’ trade wid him pussonly
fer his pussonal vote.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Here’s three dollars, Wash,” Skeeter chuckled
as he rattled the money in his hand. “You shore
is a easy nigger to trade wid.”</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_192'></a>“Jes’ ile my machinery aplenty an’ I’ll run
along smooth,” Wash grinned as he pocketed the
money. “Who is de couple you wants to win dis
prize-dance?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Figger Bush an’ Sister Solly Skaggs.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Gosh!” Wash Jones exploded as he thrust his
hand into his pocket, brought out the three dollars
and handed them back to Skeeter. “I loves money
but I ain’t troublin’ trouble.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Whut ails dem plans?” Skeeter asked, thrusting
back the hand which offered him the money.</p>

<p class='c005'>“In de fust place, Sister Solly Skaggs can’t win
a prize in no kind of dance whutsoever. She cain’t
dance no more dan a Mefdis meetin’-house. In de
secont place it’s a little too raw fer you to be de
judge of a dance an’ gib de prize to yo’ own pardner
in de saloon bizzness.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I sees de light,” Skeeter said in a surprised
tone. “I suttinly did mighty nigh slip up on dat
plan. Wonder whut we kin do to he’p you earn
dat money an’ still act honest?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dat question is ’most too heavy fer my
mind,” Wash said indifferently. “I’ll keep dis
three dollars an’ let you think up yo’ own plan.
Ef it don’t wuck, I’ll gib you yo’ money back.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Whut kind of prizes is you gwine gib, Wash?”
Skeeter asked.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Whutever kind of prizes you wants to buy,”
Wash grinned. “I leaves it wid you to pick ’em
an’ pay fer ’em.”</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_193'></a>“I thought you had ’em already selected!”
Skeeter exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Naw, suh, I figgered it out dat some nigger
would want hisse’f an’ his gal to win dem prizes so I
wus waitin’ fer him to bestow a little money on me
an’ furnish de prizes outen his own cash money.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You shore is a skillful nigger, Wash,” Skeeter
said admiringly. “I oughter run wid you a little
while an’ git some new notions in my head. You
knows how to rob ’em widout gittin’ in jail.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You better git some notions in yo’ head ’bout
dem prizes,” Wash warned him. “Dat dance is
startin’ off pretty soon.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“’Tain’t no trouble to seleck de prizes,” Skeeter
laughed. “I’ll git Sister Skaggs a little round
lookin’-glass ’bout big enough fer her to see her
nose in; an I’ll git Figger a nickel-plated cigareet
holder.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Cigareet holders comes pretty high, don’t
dey?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, suh, but I don’t mind payin’ fer one. I
been needin’ one dem things fer a long time an
I’ll make Figger gib it back to me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dat shows I ain’t de only nigger wid notions,”
Wash laughed. “Dat’s a real good trick. Is you
got it mapped out how you will git de prize to dem
two dancers?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dat ain’t no trouble.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I hopes it won’t make no trouble,” Wash
remarked.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_194'></a>“Not at all!” Skeeter assured him. “You will
be de onliest judge. Write de names of each
couple on a card an’ put all de cards in a bag.
When de times comes to gib de prizes, shake de
bag up, put in yo’ hand an’ fotch out de card wid
de names of de winners.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“How’ll I git holt of de card wid Figger’s name
on it when it’s shuck up in a bag?” Wash wanted
to know.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Take a pin an’ pin Figger’s card to de bottom
of de bag on de inside,” Skeeter explained. “All
you got to do atter dat is to reach down an’ onpin
dat card an’ fotch it out.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Wash looked at Skeeter with the utmost admiration.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Brudder Butts,” he said earnestly, “some
day I’ll take a notion to rob a rattlesnake of de
skin under its chin. When I git ready to do it
I’ll plan a little wid you an’ learn how to do it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dat wus easy,” Skeeter grinned. “I kin always
think up plenty good plans fer de yuther
feller. I falls down when I begins to study fer
myse’f.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“How come you wants dese two to win so bad?”
Wash asked.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’s tryin’ to break Pap Curtain’s nose!”
Skeeter exclaimed. “He’s atter de fat widder an’
her easy money. He aims to start a saloon, an’
I’s de leader of de highest alcoholic circles in dis
town an’ don’t need no competition.”</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_195'></a>“Nachelly you is ag’in’ dat,” Wash said
promptly. “Mebbe ef you could loant me twenty
dollars I could think up some good plan to he’p
you out.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Skeeter produced two ten-dollar bills.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Jes’ keep Pap away from Sister Skaggs, Wash,”
Skeeter said earnestly. “Dat earns dis money.
I think Pap is got a sure thing. He’s de only onmarried
nigger in Tickfall, an’ de widder will take
anybody she kin git. She ain’t choosy or she
wouldn’t never choose Pap.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I makes you one promise fer dis twenty,
Skeeter,” Wash said. “Pap won’t start no saloon
in Tickfall. As fer marryin’ de widder, I cain’t
promise dat he won’t. Not even Gawd knows
whut kind of man a widder is gwine to marry.”</p>
<h3 class='c010'>V<br /> <br />AN UNFORESEEN COMPETITOR</h3>

<p class='c011'>The one negro in Tickfall who never dressed up
was Pap Curtain. He was the well-digger and the
grave-digger of that community, and he carried
the marks of his trade upon him, clay on his
clothes, on his hands, on his hat. But to-night
for the first time in the memory of men, Pap was
arrayed in gorgeous garments. He attracted much
attention.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Whoo-pee, Pap!” Vinegar Atts bellowed. “I
<a id='Page_196'></a>cain’t make up my mind whether you is a young
nigger beginnin’ to show yo’ age, or a ole nigger
tryin’ to look lesser dan yo’ real age.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I done heerd remarks like dat a plum’ plenty,
Revun,” Pap snarled. “I admits dat I’s gwine on
seventy odd year ole.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I didn’t say you wusn’t, brudder,” Vinegar
said propitiatingly. “But whut do an ole nigger
like you dress up like you fer? Dar ain’t no fun’ral
to go to an’ us ain’t habin’ no lodge meetin’ to-night.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dey’s yuther reasons fer dressin’ up,” Pap
said with a grin.</p>

<p class='c005'>Vinegar slapped his hand to his head and a sudden
remembrance transformed his countenance.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I like to fergot dat weddin’ complete! I onderstan’
now—you’s ragged out fer de weddin’. I
muss be gittin’ ole an’ fergitful. An’ I got some
questions to ax dat widder befo’ she steps off.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Vinegar hurried away and Pap stood grinning
after him. When the colored clergyman was lost
to sight in the crowd, Pap turned away, mumbling
to himself:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dat Vinegar Atts never did hab no sense.
Now he raves an’ rambles when he talks wid
his mouth. De Shoofly needs a new up-to-date
preacher.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Pap walked over to the tabernacle, sought out
Mrs. Solly Skaggs, and bowing with exaggerated
courtesy, he asked:</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_197'></a>“Kin I dance dis here prize-dance wid you,
Sister Solly?”</p>

<p class='c005'>A shrill cackle of laughter rattled in Pap’s ear
and he turned to look into the sardonic face of
Skeeter Butts.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I done saved you, Sister Solly,” Skeeter
snickered.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You done got left, Pap,” Solly remarked. “I’s
dancin’ fer de prize wid Figger Bush.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You’s gwine to win de prize, too, Solly,”
Skeeter said in a low tone. “Dat is, ef you dances
wid Figger. You cain’t git a showin’ dancin’ wid
Pap. Ole age an’ fatness makes a powerful poor
combine in a dance.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“We ain’t axin’ you fer no remarks,” Pap
snarled, turning to Skeeter.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Beg parding fer buttin’ in, Pap,” Skeeter
laughed. “I wus jes’ surprised dat you wus takin’
up dancin’ at yo’ age.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Skeeter turned away, and as Pap had failed to
secure a partner, there was nothing for him to do
but retire from the floor, lamenting the fact that
he had paid a dime for the privilege of dancing and
lost his money. He sat down on a bench on the
edge of the throng and gave himself up to deep
meditation.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I got lef’ dat time,” he grumbled to himself.
“But dis am jes’ de fust day of de frolic. I got
plenty time yit. Fur as I know, I’s de only man aimin’
fer her, an’ de only onmarried man in de town.”</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_198'></a>He lighted a pipe and sat smoking for five
minutes. Then a new idea came:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Wash Jones is de high boss of dis show, an’ I
reckin Wash knows de widder. I oughter git
Wash to he’p me hook her.”</p>

<p class='c005'>At this point Popsy Spout wandered up to the
bench and addressed Pap.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I done loss my way in dese groun’s Pap,” he
complained. “Dar’s so many wagins an’ buggies
an’ niggers dat I can’t find de cabin whar I sleeps
at.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You ain’t aimin’ to sleep now, is you?” Pap
asked.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I goes to bed reg’lar ’bout dis time.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Eve’ybody is stayin’ up to see de dance,” Pap
said.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’s ag’in dancin’,” Popsy declared, with disgust
in his tones. “Me an’ none of my kinnery
follers atter de sinful dance. I done teached ’em
better.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Teached who better?” Pap asked quickly,
planning for revenge.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Figger an’ Scootie,” Popsy declared. “Bofe
of dem young folks abstains from de dance.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Who say dey does?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I says,” Popsy replied impatiently.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Whut would you do ef you wuster see Figger
dancin’ to-night, Popsy?” Pap asked in wheedling
tones.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’d bust his head wid my stick an’ I wouldn’t
<a id='Page_199'></a>let him inherit none of my dollars, an’ I’d drive
him an’ his nigger wife outen my cabin,” the old
man announced irately.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’s kinder skeart Figger is a deceitful nigger,
Popsy,” Pap said in a bitter voice. “I happens
to know dat he is gwine dance in de prize-dance
to-night.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“’Tain’t so,” Popsy snapped. “I done tole
Figger to go to bed.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The music started in the pavilion and Pap rose
to his feet.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Come wid me, Popsy,” Pap said. “I’ll show
you dat Figger ain’t as good as you thinks he
is.”</p>

<p class='c005'>On the edge of the crowd Popsy shaded his age-dimmed
eyes with the palm of his hand and
watched the swaying forms until he recognized
Figger Bush. Figger’s dancing partner was the
easiest thing to see on the floor, but Figger was
completely eclipsed at intervals in the convolutions
of the dance.</p>

<p class='c005'>If Mrs. Solly Skagg had been white, she would
long ago have been signed up by some enterprising
showman and her monstrosities exhibited to every
community in the country. But being of color,
she furnished a free show to all the colored people
in her vicinity, and to-night Figger Bush looked
like a pickaninny swinging on to a balloon and trying
to drag it to the ground. Mrs. Skaggs was
active, not graceful, and most of the time Figger’s
<a id='Page_200'></a>feet were in the air and he was swinging onto the
ample form of his partner with both hands.</p>

<p class='c005'>The crowd saw the fun and went into hysterics.
Popsy Spout saw the exhibition and became hysterical
also, but for other reasons. He walked
forward and pounded the floor with his patriarchal
staff and screeched Figger’s name, demanding that
he desist at once and go to bed. But four big
horns in the Tickfall brass band were blaring as
the performers tried in vain to blow out their
brains through the mouthpieces, and Popsy’s
whining voice was like the note of a cricket in a
storm.</p>

<p class='c005'>The old man finally snorted his disgust, expressing
his sentiments for the amusement of the few
around him who could hear, and tried to push his
way out of the crowd. But they were packed
densely around him, and in spite of his wishes,
Popsy had to stay and see the rewarding of the
prizes.</p>

<p class='c005'>Wash Jones stepped out and made the announcement:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dis am de fust night of de prize dancin’ an’ so
I’s bestowin’ de prize on whut I calls de lucky-name
dancers. I done wrote de name of eve’y
couple on a card an’ put de names in dis sack. I
now proceeds to shake ’em up an’ will put my han’
in dis sack an’ draw out one card. Ever who’s
name is writ on de card is de winner of dis dance,
no matter ef dey kin dance or not. To-morrer
<a id='Page_201'></a>night we will hab reg’lar app’inted judges an’ nobody
cain’t win dat cain’t dance.”</p>

<p class='c005'>He thrust his hand into the bag, stirred the cards
around for a moment, created suspense by fumbling
with the bag and making jocose remarks to
entertain the crowd. At last he found the card
pinned to the bottom of the bag, took out the pin,
and brought forth the names of the winners.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Figger Bush an’ Mrs. Solly Skaggs!”</p>

<p class='c005'>There was a moment of intense silence which
made Wash Jones wince with fear. Then a howl
of derisive laughter swept over the crowd and
every dancing couple was completely satisfied.
All thought that mere chance had determined the
selection, and all knew that Solly and Figger were
the worst dancers in the world.</p>

<p class='c005'>The lucky couple advanced and received the
prizes, bowed to the derisive crowd and started to
retire. Then Popsy Spout advanced to the center
of the dancing-floor, waving his big staff like a baseball
bat, his high, shrill, whining voice cutting the
silence like a knife.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Figger Bush, you is a wuthless, lyin’, deceitful
cuss! I done advised you to abandon dancin’
an’ you promised to do it. I tole you to go
home an’ go to bed, an’ now you done put on yo’
clothes an’ snuck outen yo’ cabin an’ come down
here to dis sinful dance. You git on home an’
when I comes I’s gwine hide you wid dis stick!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Don’t make no scenery, Popsy,” Figger
<a id='Page_202'></a>pleaded. “I didn’t really intend to dance but dis
here woman betrayed me into treadin’ a tune or
two wid her an’ I couldn’t resist.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You means dat you wus tempted by dis here
woman?” Popsy whined.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dat’s whut,” Figger replied solemnly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You go home an’ repent an’ refawm!” Popsy
shrieked. “Do it befo’ de good Lawd draps a
brickbat on yo’ head outen de sky! Git!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Figger pocketed his nickel-plated cigarette
holder and moved away.</p>

<p class='c005'>Popsy turned and surveyed the ample proportions
of Mrs. Solly Skaggs.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You needs a good steady husbunt to keep you
back from yo’ evil ways, sister,” he announced.
“You didn’t hab no call to lead my little Figger
Bush into evil ways.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I won’t do it no more, Popsy,” Mrs. Skaggs
said easily.</p>

<p class='c005'>Old Popsy Spout growled like a senile bear and
moved away. On the edge of the platform Pap
was waiting for him, feeling well satisfied with
himself and the revenge he had achieved.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Pap, Figger Bush is done cut hisse’f off from
me ferever,” the old man snapped. “I’s gwine
drive him an’ his wife outen my house an’ home.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You’ll git pretty lonesome, won’t you, Popsy?”
Pap asked idly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Naw!” the old man snapped. “I’s gwine
marry agin right away.”</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_203'></a>“Who you done picked fer de gigglin’ bride,
Popsy?” Pap asked with utter indifference.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I done picked de widder Solly Skaggs,” Popsy
proclaimed. “I’s gittin ole an’ blind an’ she’s big
enough fer me to see as fur as my eyesight goes.
By dis time nex’ year, she’ll be too fat to dance an’
us’ll bofe be of de same mind on dat. She needs
some sottled husbunt to lead her outen de error
of her ways. Excusin’ dat, she’s collected her insurance
money an’ I ain’t got no real good objections
to a little more dough. I needs it fer my ole
age.”</p>

<p class='c005'>He moved away leaving Pap Curtain gasping
for breath, stupefied by utter amazement.</p>
<h3 class='c010'>VI<br /> <br />“A CUSSIN’ CASE”</h3>

<p class='c011'>Half an hour later Skeeter and Figger met in
the Hen-Scratch saloon to discuss the events of
the evening.</p>

<p class='c005'>“We shore knocked de skin offen Pap Curtain’s
nose to-night, Figger,” Butts exulted. “Dat’s
de way so keep on. We’ll show dat ole man dat
he cain’t beat us at dis game.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Never no more fer me, Skeeter,” Figger said
earnestly. “I got to repent an’ refawm an’ dodge
brickbats. Atter you dances one time wid a ole
sook-cow like Solly, ’tain’t no trouble to repent an’
<a id='Page_204'></a>refawm. But I’s shore much ableeged fer dis cigareet
holder. I been needin’ one fer a long time.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You gimme dat cigareet holder back,” Skeeter
snapped. “Us kin use it fer all de yuther prizes,
an’ I proposes to git my money back by smokin’
it myself.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I knowed you warn’t gwine be lib’ral wid yo’
gifts,” Figger said, as he reluctantly produced the
holder and passed it to Skeeter. “I oughter lost
dat prize befo’ I showed up here.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You kin git de good outen it by watchin’ me
smoke it,” Skeeter snickered. “An’ ef we bust
Pap’s plans about startin’ a saloon, mebbe I’ll let
you smoke it a few times to keep yo’ feelin’s from
gittin’ hurt.”</p>

<p class='c005'>At that moment the door of the saloon opened
and old Isaiah Gaitskill came across the room to
where the two men sat at a table. Isaiah was one of
the landmarks of Tickfall, withered and wrinkled
and dry like the hull of a walnut, his gray hair fitting
his head like a rubber cap, over eighty years
of age, but as hard and active as a soldier.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ole fellers like you oughter be in bed, Isaiah,”
Skeeter announced as he waved the visitor to a
chair.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Fellers nearly as ole as me is not only stayin’
up late but dey is figgerin’ ’bout gittin’ married,”
Isaiah replied with a grin.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Pap Curtain ain’t nigh as old as you,” Figger
retorted.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_205'></a>“’Tain’t Pap I’s alludin’ to,” Isaiah answered.
“It’s brudder Popsy Spout whut’s studyin’ mattermony.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Many things had happened to those two young
men in their variegated and adventurous careers,
but nothing had ever happened to produce such a
shock as Isaiah’s announcement. Figger uttered
a startled exclamation, started to rise from his
seat, then sank back with his chin in his collar and
collapsed like a punctured tire. Skeeter Butts
pawed the air in front of his face with both hands
as if fighting off invisible insects; he made inarticulate
noises in his throat, shut his teeth down so
hard on his celluloid nickel-plated cigarette holder
that he split it for two inches, and then exclaimed
despairingly:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, whoosh!”</p>

<p class='c005'>The sound was like the feeble exhaust of an automobile
that is utterly worn out and broken down
and never intends to be serviceable again.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I come aroun’ to ax you-alls is Popsy still got
dat thousan’ dollars in Marse Tom Gaitskill’s
bank,” Isaiah proceeded, taking no notice of the
terrible effect of his announcement.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Whoosh!” Skeeter sighed again.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I got a notion dat Popsy’s suttinly still got it,”
Isaiah continued. “Dat ole monkey don’t spen’
no money—he saves it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Whoosh!” Skeeter muttered.</p>

<p class='c005'>There was a long silence, the men looking at
<a id='Page_206'></a>each other without a word. After a while Isaiah
began to drum on the table with his horny fingernails,
and the sound was as annoying and as
startling in the stillness as the <i>rat-a-tat-tat</i> of a
woodpecker trying to drill a hole through a tin
roof. Slowly Figger recovered his power of speech.
He glared at Skeeter uttering one intelligible
sentence:</p>

<p class='c005'>“You is to blame fer dis!”</p>

<p class='c005'>And then he began to “cuss.” It was an edifying
exhibition to one interested in the use of forcible
words, interested in the efficiency attained
through long practice and experience, and interested
in knowing how copious is the English language in
terms of profanity, blasphemy, and execration.</p>

<p class='c005'>Isaiah listened, casting a glance of admiration
toward Figger now and then as he heard some
especially pregnant phrases of vituperation, then
he said:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Save a few cuss-words fer future use, Figger.
You’ll need ’em.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Keep on, Figger,” Skeeter said encouragingly.
“Dis here is a cussin’ case an’ you ain’t done de
case justice even yit.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I ain’t gwine stay here an’ listen,” Isaiah
snapped. “I jes’ stopped by to ax about Popsy’s
finances. Ef he’s still got de dough he had when
he arrived up at dis town, he’s got twicet as much
as de gal he’s studin’ to marry an’ dat’ll make a
good match.”</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_207'></a>“Hol’ on, Isaiah,” Figger wailed. “Who did
you say Popsy wus aimin’ to marry?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I ain’t specified,” Isaiah grinned, reaching for
his hat and preparing to go. “But I don’t mind
tellin’—it’s my stepchile by my fourth wife’s fust
marriage, Mrs. Solly Skaggs!”</p>

<p class='c005'>The exclamation which Figger uttered at this
information indicated that he had exhausted all
the treasuries of speech: language could go no
further.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I tole you to save some cuss-words,” Isaiah
grinned.</p>

<p class='c005'>Skeeter groaned, fanning himself with his hat.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dar won’t be enough room in Popsy’s little
cabin fer Figger an’ his wife an’ Popsy an’ his
wife,” he meditated aloud. “Solly is a cabin-full
all by herse’f.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Popsy is shore gittin’ plenty fer his money,”
Isaiah chuckled. “I’s glad she’s ended up dat
way. Dat fat gal kin eat as much as fo’teen
chillun an’ a cow an’ a calf. I don’t hanker to
suppote her.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“How come Popsy made up his mind to ack a
fool so suddent?” Skeeter wailed.</p>

<p class='c005'>“He seen Figger dancin’ wid Solly an’ he don’t
approve of dat exoncise. He’s marryin’ Solly to
refawm her an’ to git him a new housekeeper because
he’s gwine chase Figger an’ Scootie outen
his cabin fer deceivin’ him.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Sometimes when you step on the shell of a dead
<a id='Page_208'></a>turtle it makes a ridiculous squeak. Figger made
a noise like that.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Bad luck, Figger,” Skeeter said sympathetically,
as he took the broken nickel-plated cigarette
holder from his mouth and handed it to Figger.
“I gives you dis little present to show my sad
feelin’s todes you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Figger’s mental perturbation was such that he
stuck it in his mouth, struck a match and tried to
light it without placing a cigarette on the end.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dis is awful,” he sighed.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I reckin Popsy is expeckin’ me back about
now,” Isaiah remarked as he arose. “As Solly’s
nachel gardeen, he axed me to speak up to Solly
an’ find out ef she wus willin’. But fust I come
to see how Popsy wus fixed financial. Solly ain’t
hankerin’ to take in no white folks’ washin’s to
suppote a ole gizzard like Popsy.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Whar is Popsy now?” Skeeter asked eagerly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“He’s at Shin Bone’s resterant here in town,”
Isaiah replied.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Us will go wid you, Isaiah!” Skeeter exclaimed.
“Ef dar’s a weddin’ plannin’ I wants to he’p it
along.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The three men hurried to the eating-house as
rapidly as Figger’s feeble knees could carry him.
Skeeter had to support his friend by holding his
arm, for all Figger’s vital force was gone. They
found Popsy the only patron of the place and he
was using a long table in the middle of the room,
<a id='Page_209'></a>not for the consumption of food, but for a bed! He
was stretched out full length on the table, his arm
under his head for a pillow, his rusty stove-pipe
hat placed beside him.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dis here bridegroom is takin’ a nap,” Skeeter
snickered, as he walked in and sat down at the
table beside the sleeping man. The others saw
no reason to arouse him from his slumbers, so they
sat down beside him and looked at the sleeper.
Skeeter walked to another table, picked up a
stalk of celery and brought it back and placed
it in Popsy’s hand where it rested upon his
breast.</p>

<p class='c005'>Taking off his hat, he placed it with exaggerated
solemnity over his heart and sighed with pitiable
sadness:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Don’t he look nachel? Ain’t dat a sweet smile
on his face? He looks jes’ like I seed him yistiddy—ain’t
changed a bit!”</p>

<p class='c005'>He walked over to Figger, leaned down, and
whispered:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Wus you acquainted wid de corp’?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I knowed him real good,” Figger answered,
glaring at the prostrate form. “He shore wus a
devilish ole cranky nigger.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“When does de fun’ral orgies take place?”
Skeeter whispered. “Is de Revun Vinegar Atts
gwine ’fishiate at de ’terment? Po’ ole man—atter
all his troubles, he is at rest!”</p>

<p class='c005'>A slovenly waitress approached the whispering
<a id='Page_210'></a>men, yawned prodigiously, and gazed at Popsy
with a stupid face.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I wants you-alls to wake up Popsy an’ tote
him off home to bed. Dis here ain’t no nursery.
I’s sleepy an’ it’s time to shet up dis house.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Pap Curtain, on his way home from Coon Island,
saw the men gathered around Popsy and entered.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Whut ails Popsy, brudders?” he exclaimed.
“Is de ole man sick?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Naw,” Skeeter snapped. “No such good luck.
Mebbe ef he sleeped here till mawnin’ he’d roll off
dis table an’ break his fool neck!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“He’s love-sick,” old Isaiah cackled. “He
gittin’ ready to marry.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Shore!” Pap snarled. “He tripped up my
legs an’ throwed me down. I wus in hopes
Popsy wus sick—less shove him off dis table an’
kill him!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then another man entered the restaurant. He
was a fat, pot-bellied negro, his head bald except
for two tufts of hair growing over his ears which
made him look like a big fat-faced mule wearing a
blind bridle.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Hello, brudders!” the Rev. Vinegar Atts bellowed.
“How come you-alls didn’t stay at de
weddin’?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Never heard tell about dat’n,” Skeeter exclaimed.
“Who is de victims?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Brudder Wash Jones an’ Sister Solly Skaggs!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Whoo-pee-ee!” Figger Bush screamed. “De
<a id='Page_211'></a>Lawd wus shorely wid me. Wash is done saved
my life!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Figger’s wild yell of exultation aroused Popsy
from his slumbers. He sat up and rubbed his eyes.
Then he saw Isaiah Gaitskill.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I done decided not to marry Solly, Brudder
Isaiah,” he whined. “I tuck a little nap an’ I
dreamt a dream dat Calline, my fust wife, come to
me an’ warned me to beware of widders. She said
dey wus awful treach’rous an’ deceivin’.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Calline is got it right, Popsy,” Pap sighed.
“My little romance is snipped in de bud.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Wash an’ Solly had dat case fixed up in N’
Awleens,” Vinegar told them. “Solly wouldn’t
marry Wash onless he had de same amount of
money dat she inherited from her husbunt. So
Wash arrived in Tickfall, started a Coon Island
like N’ Yawk has, collected five hundred admissions
at one dollar per each, married Solly an’ lit
out on de midnight train.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Whut becomes of dat Coon Island?” Pap
asked.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Wash axed me to hand dat whole shebang over
to you fer a consolation prize,” Vinegar answered.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>I</h3>

<p class='c011'>“Dis here nigger Uplift League is shore gittin’
active, Figger,” Skeeter Butts remarked one morning
as he entered the Hen-Scratch saloon and
seated himself at a table beside his partner.</p>

<p class='c005'>Figger Bush sat with his knife-blade poised over
the top of the pine table, trying to devise some
new design to carve upon that piece of furniture.
He showed his lack of interest in the league by
replying:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dem Uplifters ain’t gwine lift me up. I’s a
heavy-weight.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You always wus a sinker,” Skeeter smiled, as
he watched Figger sketch the outline of an Indian
face in the soft pine with his knife-point before beginning
to carve. “You jes’ nachelly went down
ever since I knowed you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dese Uplifters is uppity, biggity, high-brow
niggers. Dey’s always jawin’ about high cullud
sawciety, an’ who b’longs an’ who ain’t b’long.
Dey ain’t black folks; dey’s play-like whites.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dey’s actin’ an’ playin’ like niggers now,”
<a id='Page_213'></a>Skeeter grinned. “Dey’s in a awful row ’bout
who’s gwine be elected to de high-up offices of de
Uplift. I never seed de beat of de politickin’ dey’s
doin’.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Nobody ain’t politicked me yit,” Figger murmured,
as his knife slowly moved through the soft
pine. “I reckin votes ain’t fetchin’ so awful high
price.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dem Uplifters is gwine uplift de price befo’
de election is over,” Skeeter told him. “Ef I had
a real loud voice an’ could holler an’ bawl an’
whoop, I’d run fer presidunt of de league myself.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You jes’ fergit dem notions off yo’ mind,”
Figger growled. “I ain’t aimin’ to keep dis saloon
an’ do all de odd jobs while you yelps aroun’ like
a kicked dawg about whut oughter be done fer de
poor, oppressed cullud race.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But de Uplifters is done fergot de po’, oppressed
cullud niggers an’ is thinkin’ up cuss names
to call each yuther wid,” Skeeter explained.
“Some Uplifters ain’t in favor of de way de yuther
uplifts is liftin’, an’ dey’s tryin’ to git good riddunce
of Mustard Prophet an’ put Pap Curtain in
his place as presidunt.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Pap Curtain is a slick-head nigger,” Figger
growled. “He’s heap mo’ crookeder dan a dawg’s
hind leg. Nobody cain’t never git Pap straight.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dat’s de kind of man to git elected,” Skeeter
snickered. “It’ll take a slick-head to beat
Mustard.”</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_214'></a>“You real shore dey ain’t gwine run you fer
presidunt?” Figger asked suspiciously.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dey ain’t got no notion of dat kind,” Skeeter
replied. “Dey don’t see me at all. Dis here is
gwine be a real election an’ it takes a loud speecher
to git votes. My voice is too squeaky an’ my size
is ag’in’ me. A little runt like me wid a screech-owl
voice couldn’t git elected as free-meat man in
a dawg town.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’s glad you’s so modest, Skeeter,” his friend
grinned. “My idear is dat dis saloon is gwine be
de chiefest headquarters of bofe sides of de Uplifters.
We’ll rake in a heap of dollars by bein’
puffeckly neuter in dis race. Ef we takes sides,
we loses money.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dat’s so,” Skeeter agreed. “But I heerd Pap
Curtain talkin’ down in Dirty-Six an’ Pap got de
right notion. He says dat we need new blood in de
Uplift League. He says dem officers whut’s got
de honors now jes’ holds deir jobs an’ don’t do
nothin’. He says our race is sinkin’ down because
dem Uplifters ain’t liftin’ up. He says dat de pusson
who will git charge of dat league an’ make it
active an’ yellervate de race will be Tickfall’s most
leadin’ cullud sitson.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I wouldn’t objeck to bein’ de leadin’ member
of de Tickfall blacks,” Figger sighed. “But I’s
like you—I ain’t got de voice. I’s got de heft on
you, but I don’t weigh as much as Hitch Diamond
or Vinegar Atts, an’ ef weight an’ voice is gwine
<a id='Page_215'></a>win out, Ginny Babe Chew is got us all beat a
mile.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dat’s a funny thing about dis here race,”
Skeeter chuckled. “Ginny Babe Chew is a runnin’,
too!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Uhuh!” Figger grunted. “Dat means dat
eve’y Uplifter in de league is gwine have a rep onless
dey votes fer her. Dat ole woman knows all
de sins all de niggers in Tickfall is cormitted. She
tells ’em, too. An’ when it comes to callin’ cuss-names,
all us is new beginners to Ginny Babe. Dat
gal’s had expe’unce.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I ain’t gwine mess wid it, Figger,” Skeeter
said, as he thought uneasily of the things Ginny
might tell about him. “I don’t want my rep ruint
by Ginny Babe. Us’ll bofe be neuter an’ keep dis
saloon.”</p>

<p class='c005'>At that moment the door of the saloon was
pushed open and a diminutive darky named Little
Bit entered.</p>

<p class='c005'>Little Bit had apparently robbed a woman’s
wardrobe for his wearing apparel. For coat, he
wore the upper half of a woman’s coat-suit, the
tail flapping down around his knees and the sleeves
rolled up to his elbows to give exit to his short
arms. For a shirt, he wore a woman’s shirt-waist,
silk material, flowered and lacy and frilled.
We presume that the woman’s husband had contributed
the masculine portion of the attire, for
the trousers had originally belonged to a man
<a id='Page_216'></a>much larger in the waist and much longer in the
legs than Little Bit, and the pants were hitched
about his middle and cut off at the knees. For
hose, he wore—here I cross my heart and hope I
may die—a woman’s purple-silk stockings, ending
at the feet with a pair of ladies’ pumps, gray suède
in color with high French heels!</p>

<p class='c005'>“Whar in de name of mud is you been at?”
Skeeter Butts howled as he glared at his wristwatch.
“Is you wuckin’ in dis saloon or is you
ain’t? You expeck me to pay you wages when
you comes here at mighty nigh dinner-time an’
aims to do a day’s wuck?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I been listenin’ to Pap Curtain make a speech,”
Little Bit snickered. “He’s got a chunk of rock
salt in one hand an’ a sour lemon in de yuther, an’
he’s talkin’ about all de sins of de Uplifters. He
wants me to he’p him win out.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You!” Skeeter Butts shrieked.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You!” Figger howled.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Suttinly,” Little Bit answered. “I got plenty
influence an’ kin git a lot of votes. Pap say to me
dat plenty offices is to be give away to his supporters
ef he gits elected an’ he done tipped me off
dat I’ll be de fust high janitor at four dollars per
mont’ pay.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But me an’ Figger is gwine be neuter in dis
race,” Skeeter snapped. “De Hen-Scratch saloon
will be de grand high headquarters of all de politics.
Dis saloon mussn’t take no sides.”</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_217'></a>“I ain’t no pardner here,” Little Bit replied.
“Nobody won’t pay no mind to me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“All right,” Skeeter said after a moment’s
thought. “I reckin you don’t count fer nothin’
nohow. But I don’t stand fer no politickin’ about
dis place. Ef you gits to makin’ any of Pap’s
speeches fer him, I’ll shore suppress you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Little Bit shuffled his high-heeled pumps in a
few dance steps to show his contempt for this
warning and passed out.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I hope dis politics disease ain’t ketchin’,”
Figger sighed. “Little Bit is done got de germ.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“’Tain’t ketchin’,” Skeeter assured him. “But
I shore hopes Pap is gwine win out or some yuther
good man. Mustard Prophet oughter be
squelched.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I ain’t huntin’ no job like dat,” Figger replied
as he closed his knife and looked with admiration
upon his handiwork. “I’s gwine home to my
dinner. Scootie is cooked some hot cakes an’ I’m
got a gallon of sirup.”</p>
<h3 class='c010'>II</h3>

<p class='c011'>In Pap Curtain’s career he had driven many
carriages which transported over the Parish of
Tickfall the candidates for the offices within the
gift of the people. He now recalled to his profit
that every prospective Congressman, Governor,
and Senator went from house to house, seeking
<a id='Page_218'></a>out each voter, loudly enunciating their political
principles, and soliciting their votes.</p>

<p class='c005'>Figger Bush, on his way home to his dinner of
hot cakes and sirup, found a little group of negroes
standing on a corner in Dirty-Six, with Pap Curtain
in the midst. Pap gesticulated with his left hand,
which held a lemon, and his harsh, snarling voice
clearly enunciated the principles on which he
hoped to be elected president of the Tickfall Uplift
League.</p>

<p class='c005'>Figger slipped quietly around the little group,
determined to go on his way. But Pap would let
no possible voter escape.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ain’t dat so, Brudder Figger Bush?” Pap
howled.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Whut?” Figger asked, brought to a sudden halt.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ain’t whut I been sayin’ true fer a fack?” Pap
demanded.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I ain’t heerd nothin’,” Figger mumbled, longing
to escape.</p>

<p class='c005'>Pap walked over and laid an impressive and
detaining hand upon Figger’s shoulder. The
crowd moved with Pap and enclosed him, and
Figger found himself shut in on all sides.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I been explavacatin’ dat de Uplift League ain’t
been run right. Ain’t dat so?” Pap snarled.</p>

<p class='c005'>“’Tain’t been run to suit me,” Figger murmured
knowing that he could escape more easily
if he agreed with Pap than would be possible if he
started an argument.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_219'></a>“Suttin, it ain’t!” Pap howled triumphantly.
“’Tain’t been run to suit nobody. De dues is too
high, de members of de league is too choosy about
admittin’ new members, an’ a poor an’ meek-seemin’
man ain’t got no show. Ain’t dat right?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Shore is,” Figger muttered, with some reluctance.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You know how ’tis yo’ own self, Figger!” Pap
howled, elated over Figger’s endorsement of his
position. “I remember once you wusn’t allowed
to come inside de league meetin’ because you had
on shoes ’thout no socks!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dat’s so,” Figger agreed.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I argufies dat wus a insult an’ a outrage!” Pap
snarled. “Don’t you agree wid dem sentiments?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, suh.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I proclamates dat de members of de league
oughter be allowed to dress as dey dern please,”
Pap howled. “Let ’em come wid socks or widout
socks—dem’s my docterines!”</p>

<p class='c005'>A murmur of acquiescence arose from the little
group, and Pap with true oratorical instinct felt
that he had shot off the one big set-piece of fireworks
in his display, and that he had better quit
at his climax. Let it be said to his credit that he
did not linger to shoot off a single lonesome skyrocket
of eloquence, but closed his mouth right
there, and laid hold upon Figger’s arm and led him
down the street and away from the rest of the
group.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_220'></a>“I wants you to go to my cabin wid me, Figger,”
he whispered. “Us oughter git togedder an’ whup
out dem ins an’ git in ourselves.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Scootie is expectin’ me home ’bout now,”
Figger remonstrated.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I won’t keep you long,” Pap assured him.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Whut you think is my chance to git elected?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I reckin you got some show ef you kin git
enough niggers to vote fer you,” Figger told him.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It’s principles dat gits votes,” Pap proclaimed.
“I’s preachin’ de only docterine whut hits a nigger
right—eve’y feller do as he please!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Preachin’ don’t git no votes,” Figger disagreed.
“Mostest votes is got by de man whut gits de
mostest niggers to vote fer him and wuck fer
him.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dat’s why I needs you, Figger,” Pap said, as
they walked up the steps and sat down on a bench
on Curtain’s porch. “I wants you to come in wid
me an he’p me git elected.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dar ain’t nothin’ in de race fer me,” Figger
declined promptly. “I don’t care who is de head
leader of de league. I ain’t in de Uplift bizzness.
I’s in de barroom bizzness.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dar’s plenty in it fer you,” Pap told him. “A
presidunt is got to hab a vice-presidunt, ain’t he?
I wants you to run wid me an’ be my vice-presidunt.
In case I dies or gits in jail, you gits de
presidunt job.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Figger Bush drew in his breath sharply, then
<a id='Page_221'></a>sat for a long time in silence, looking into the thick
branches of an umbrella china-tree. Honors had
been suddenly thrust upon him. Pap was old and
his chance of dying was good. He was a “slick-head”
negro, and his chance of getting into jail
was better. It did not require much imagination
for Figger Bush to see all obstacles cleared away,
and behold himself as the honored president of
the Uplift League.</p>

<p class='c005'>Scootie’s hot cakes got cold; Figger never did
come home to eat them.</p>

<p class='c005'>Skeeter Butts tended bar alone until sundown
before he saw his partner again. When Figger
entered, Skeeter howled:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Looky here, you done been gone long enough
to go to a fun’ral an’ mourn de loss of yo’ best
frien’. Did dem hot cakes knock you out?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ain’t had none,” Figger answered, glancing
up in surprise at the sudden recollection of his lost
dinner. “Fergot all about ’em.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Whut ails you? Whar you been at? De fust
notion you know, you’ll git fired!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ef I gits elected, I don’t keer ef——”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ef you git—whut?” Skeeter interrupted, his
eyes bulging with astonishment, which rapidly
changed to anger and disgust.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Pap Curtain is candidated me to run fer vice-presidunt
wid him,” Figger explained. “Ef Pap
dies or gits in jail, I gits to be plum’ presidunt. De
chances is pretty good. Pap digs wells fer a livin’
<a id='Page_222'></a>an’ he’s got plenty good chances to git blowed wid
dynamite.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Positively not!” Skeeter howled. “Dynamite
might blow up whar Pap wus, but ’tain’t
never been quick enough to blow up whar Pap
is.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Anyhow, Pap’s a snoopy, slick-head nigger,
an’ he’s got a good chance to git in jail,” Figger
continued.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Listen to yo’ fool talk!” Skeeter ranted.
“Slick-heads don’t never git in jail. Dey chooses
’em a pardner or a vice-presidunt, an’ it’s dat mud-head
dat gits in jail.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Anyways, I’ll shore be presidunt some of de
time, because when de gram jury meets, Pap always
gits de trabbel-itch an’ leaves town,” Figger
rambled on.</p>

<p class='c005'>Overcome by an assortment of emotions, Skeeter
Butts placed his feet on the table and let himself
down in his chair until he was sitting on his
shoulder-blades. He fanned himself with his
derby hat and glared at Figger fairly speechless
with wrath.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Of co’se, I mought not git elected, but me ’n’
Pap will gib ’em a good race——”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You bet you ain’t gwine be elected,” Skeeter
shrieked. “You ain’t gwine be allowed to run!
You’s de wuss loontick I ever did see.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I ain’t no loontick,” Figger retorted. “De
last words you said to me befo’ I lef’ fer dinner—an’
<a id='Page_223'></a>I shore regrets dat I loss dat dinner by deprivity—you
said you hoped Pap would git elected.
Now I ups an’ offers to he’p Pap an’ you go poppin’
off——”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Stop talkin’ to me about Pap Curtain,” Skeeter
shouted. “Dat ole brayin’ jackace is jes’ makin’ a
noise to git hisself heard. He won’t lose nothin’
ef he gits beat, but ef you runs wid Pap, us is gwine
to lose half dis saloon bizzness because de yuther
side won’t paternize us none.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Figger gasped for breath.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I fergot that arrangement entirely, Skeeter,”
he exclaimed. “Us wus gwine keep out of it. But
dat won’t be so awful bad. Pap an’ me an’ our
crowd will suppote de Hen-Scratch.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’s sorry you done mint us, Figger,” Skeeter
said sadly as he arose to go out for his evening
meal. “But I freely admits dat you wus a fool
an’ didn’t know no better.”</p>
<h3 class='c010'>III</h3>

<p class='c011'>Skeeter slapped his derby hat on his head with
such force that it popped like a tambourine in a
minstrel show, and stalked angrily out of the
room.</p>

<p class='c005'>He moped down the street and sauntered slowly
into the Shin Bone restaurant, sighing pitifully and
feeling very sorry for himself.</p>

<p class='c005'>A slovenly waitress suppressed a yawn, shuffled
<a id='Page_224'></a>across the floor in slipshod shoes, and asked indifferently:
“Whut’s yours?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Skeeter waited a moment, hoping that his appearance
of personified calamity would impress
the woman and she would sympathize with his
heart-break, but she looked like she was going to
sleep while standing in the middle of the floor so
he barked his order:</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’s had so many troubles my appetite is plum’
gone, Pearly. Gimme a plate of gumbo soup, a
dozen fried oystyers, a bait of fried catfish, two
slices of apple pie an’ a glass of milk, a hunk of
watermelon an’ a cup of coffee.”</p>

<p class='c005'>He smoked cigarettes and thought up mean
things to say to Figger Bush until the order was
filled, then courted suffocation for twenty minutes
by eating so rapidly that he did not take the time
to breathe.</p>

<p class='c005'>He had reached out for the pie and milk when
Shin Bone, the proprietor of the eating-house,
came from behind a screen and seated himself at
the same table.</p>

<p class='c005'>“’Lo, Shinny,” Skeeter mumbled as he tried to
stuff a whole slice of pie in his mouth at one time,
and therefore became incapable of coherent speech
for the next few minutes.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Hello,” Shin replied, watching Skeeter with
interest until the last of the first slice of pie was
washed down by the milk. “How’s bizzness?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“’Tain’t so awful bad,” Skeeter replied. “You
<a id='Page_225'></a>an’ me is got good trades. Folks comes to yo’
place because dey gits hungry reg’lar, an’ dey
comes to me because dey gits thirsty reg’lar. All
we got to do is to wait till dey comes.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I ain’t find dat true now, Skeeter,” Shin said
gloomily. “Wid me, bizzness is plum’ rotten.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“How come?” Skeeter asked unconcernedly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Pol’tics.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Skeeter’s interest revived. His second slice of
pie lingered half a foot from his mouth, poised
upon his hand.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dis here Uplift League election has done loss
me all de customers I’m got,” Shin mourned. “Dey
done boycotted me, an’ tunked my bizzness in de
head wid a ax.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dey hadn’t oughter done it,” Skeeter exclaimed,
working himself into a panic. “How
did it come to pass?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“My wife, Whiffle, is de niece of Pap Curtain,”
Shin explained. “Pap is runnin’ fer de presidunt
of de Liftuppers ag’in Mustard Prophet.
All niggers dat favors Mustard is done cut me
out.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But Pap oughter git you some customers,”
Skeeter protested.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Pap ain’t got de right follerin’,” Shin sighed.
“Niggers dat votes wid Pap is de no-shirt, no-sock
outfit, an’ dat kind ain’t got no money to buy
vittles. Dey begs deir grub from de cook-ladies
in de white folks’ kitchen. Mustard Prophet is
<a id='Page_226'></a>got de high-brow, uppity niggers wid him an’ dey’s
got de money an’ eats here wid me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Skeeter nodded in speechless comprehension of
the tragedy, the hand which held the pie wavered
and sank slowly to the table, for that pie didn’t
look good to Skeeter any more.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dem Mustard Prophet voters say dey ain’t
never comin’ in here no more,” Shin said dolefully.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ef dey don’t feel no better dan I does now,
dey wouldn’t fotch you much trade, fer dey
couldn’t eat no more dan a brass monkey,” Skeeter
sighed, pulling his slice of watermelon closer to
him, although unconscious of his action. Beads
of apprehensive perspiration stood out on his forehead
and a sudden weakness assailed him.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Whut ails you, Skeeter?” Shin inquired solicitously,
for Skeeter had suddenly collapsed like a
punctured tire. “Don’t you feel good?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Somepin I done et is disagreed wid me,”
Skeeter moaned. “Lemme git dis coffee down
me befo’ I die!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Shin waited until Skeeter consumed his coffee
and rallied.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Of co’se, Whiffle cain’t he’p bein’ my wife, an’
she cain’t he’p bein’ kin to Pap, an’ we bofe cain’t
he’p it ef Pap runs fer presidunt, but we shore is
got our nose broke.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Don’t tell me no more, Shinny,” Skeeter exclaimed,
waving both hands and rising to his feet.
“My head is crazy now.”</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_227'></a>“Is you got troubles, too?” Shin asked sympathetically.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Troubles?” Skeeter howled. “Ain’t you heerd
about Figger Bush? He’s runnin’ fer vice-presidunt
wid Pap Curtain.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You an’ me bofe blowed up suckers, Skeeter,”
Shin said in tragic tones. “Our bizzness is bum
an’ busted.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It’s powerful bad, Shinny,” Skeeter agreed.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Badder dan you think, Skeeter,” Shin said.
“Pap an’ Figger is shore to be elected.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“How does you dope dat out?” Skeeter asked,
panting for breath.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It lines up dis way,” Shin informed him.
“Ginny Babe Chew is runnin’ her petticoat pol’tics
fer presidunt. All of Pap’s follerers is sinners in de
sight of de Lawd, an’ Ginny Babe Chew is done
pronounced on deir sins copious an’ frequent, so
Pap an’ his crowd hates her. In dat case, Mustard
Prophet ain’t gwine git as many votes as he oughter
had because Ginny Babe is runnin’ an’ she’ll git
her voters from Mustard’s crowd. Of co’se, when
de high-brows splits up deir vote, Pap an’ Figger
will snow ’em over an’ got in solid.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Skeeter felt a sudden weakness in his knees and
sat down forcibly on the top of the table. Whereupon
he felt considerable moisture in the vicinity
of his coat-tail and sprang up to find that he had
seated himself upon his slice of watermelon.</p>

<p class='c005'>“By jacks!” he exclaimed dramatically.
<a id='Page_228'></a>“Figger is done ruint my bizzness an’ I done ruint
my pants!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ef I wus you, I’d git rid of ’em bofe,” Shin
suggested, as Skeeter walked out of the restaurant,
wiping the moisture from his trousers with his
handkerchief.</p>

<p class='c005'>When Skeeter had gone, Shin found that the
slice of watermelon had not been completely
crushed and was not entirely unedible, so he drew
himself up to the table and thankfully ate the
uninjured part.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ef Skeeter wusn’t such a lightweight, dis whole
chunk would hab been sp’iled,” he grinned.</p>

<p class='c005'>He felt better after eating the melon until he
suddenly recalled that Skeeter had left the eating-house
without paying for his meal.</p>

<p class='c005'>When Skeeter was outside of the restaurant, he
promptly forgot his trousers and started for his
home in a trot. He went up the long hill toward
the Flournoy place like a brown shadow passing
through the darkness, threw open the door of a
little shed and seized the crank of his “flivver.”</p>

<p class='c005'>A moment later he was out in the public highway,
speeding through the night toward the Nigger-Heel
plantation, on which Mustard Prophet
was the overseer.</p>

<p class='c005'>He found Mustard sitting on the porch of his
house, shirtless and barefooted, smoking a vile
corncob pipe.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Set down, Skeeter,” he said in greeting. “Take
<a id='Page_229'></a>off all yo’ clothes an’ git cool. Dar ain’t no lady
folks aroun’.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I feel real chilly, Mustard,” Skeeter said in
reply. “Dat is, I’s got cold foots.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Whut ails you?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I been hearin’ dat a move is started to kick
you out as presidunt of de Liftup League.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dat’s so,” Mustard said indifferently. “Dey
cusses me fer whut I does an’ dey cusses me fer
whut I ain’t do, an’ now dey is tryin’ to boost me
out an’ drap me down.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I don’t favor it, Mustard,” Skeeter said earnestly.
“I come out to offer my he’p. You
oughter hab me to scuffle fer you durin’ de day
while you got to wuck on dis plantation.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dat’s a good notion, Skeeter,” Mustard said
thankfully. “I app’ints you he’per right now.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Hol’ on, Mustard,” Skeeter said. “It don’t
go so fast an’ easy as dat. In de fust place, I
wants de Hen-Scratch saloon to be de headquarters
of yo’ side in de race.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ll arrange dat,” Mustard said easily.</p>

<p class='c005'>“In de nex’ place, I wants to run wid you on yo’
side fer vice-presidunt,” Skeeter continued.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ll fix dat easy,” Mustard said. “Dar ain’t
nobody wid good sense dat wants to be vice-presidunt
of nothin’. Dat’s like bein’ de curl in a pig’s
tail—jes’ ornamental behind.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“’Tain’t no diffunce, I wants dat job,” Skeeter
insisted.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_230'></a>“I announces you to-morrer,” Mustard said.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dat’s all, Mustard,” Skeeter concluded, as he
slapped his hat on his head. “I got to hustle back
now an’ start my voters to wuckin’.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dar now!” Skeeter said to himself exultantly,
as his little machine rattled off the miles back to
Tickfall. “I done got dat fixed right. Figger is
vice-presidunt on one side an’ I is vice-presidunt
on de yuther side, an’ bofe sides is promised to
make de Hen-Scratch deir headquarters.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Seven miles of sandy road slipped under his
flying wheels like a brown ribbon while he contemplated
this master stroke of business. He
placed his little machine under the shed and
climbed into bed before he spoke to himself again:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dat’s whut I calls a good sense compromise.”</p>
<h3 class='c010'>IV</h3>

<p class='c011'>“Now, Figger,” Skeeter Butts announced the
next morning, “I got such a idjut fer a partner in
dis here saloon dat I had to go git myse’f candidated
fer pol’tics.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Is you runnin’ fer presidunt?” Figger asked.
“I thought you said you squealed too much when
you talked.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’s runnin’ fer vice-presidunt,” Skeeter said
solemnly. “I’s runnin’ wid Mustard Prophet an’
us is shore gwine gib you an’ Pap Curtain a happy
time gittin’ elected.”</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_231'></a>“Dat looks bad to me, Skeeter—pardners in
bizzness runnin’ ag’in’ each yuther.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dat’s de best bizzness trick I’s done yit,”
Skeeter said confidently. “Bofe sides uses dis
house fer headquarters. I sells drinks to de Mustard
Prophets an’ you sells drinks to de Pap Curtains,
an’ we ketch ’em comin’ an’ gwine.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I sees,” Figger exclaimed in a voice which
throbbed with admiration. “Dat’s de best nigger
idear in Tickfall. We’ll git rich an’ one of us will
git elected.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Look out fer Ginny Babe Chew!” the voice of
Little Bit proclaimed from the other end of the
room, where the little darky wrestled with a
broom. “She’s de one whut’ll ketch you-alls
comin’ an’ gwine!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Us don’t care nothin’ fer dat ole squawkin’ fat
hen,” Skeeter replied contemptuously.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You better not git too close,” Little Bit warned.
“Dat ole hen’ll peck you!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Shut up! You git dis saloon cleant up. Us
is expect plenty comp’ny to-day.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It wus a narrer squeak fer us, Figger,” Skeeter
said earnestly. “When you didn’t stay neuter
dis bizzness wus ’bout to go bust ontil I made dem
new arrangements.”</p>

<p class='c005'>During the day Pap Curtain came in and held
sundry whispered conferences with Figger Bush.
Mustard Prophet drove to town and was closeted
for two hours with Skeeter Butts. Both men were
<a id='Page_232'></a>arranging for a conference at the Hen-Scratch
saloon that night with their henchmen, and both
barkeepers were feeling elated at the prospect of a
prosperous evening.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then Vinegar Atts entered and spoiled it all.
He left his little red runabout snorting and spitting
outside the door while he entered with haste carrying
some of the paraphernalia of a fisherman.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Gimme a little snake-bite med’cine, Skeeter,”
he yelled. “I’s in a hurry. I’s gwine fishin’ an’
I’s heard tell dat snakes in plenty in de swamp.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Is fish bitin’?” Figger inquired.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dunno,” Vinegar replied. “I done selected
dis occupation to keep from stayin’ in town. Dat
Uplift election is done deprived me of my goat. I’s
skeart to stay here an’ git on either side. It’ll
bust up my Shoofly chu’ch.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ef us wus twins an’ could git on bofe sides,
dat wouldn’t be so bad, would it?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Whar you been at dat you don’t know
nothin’?” demanded Vinegar in disgusted tones.
“Some of dem niggers whut represent bofe sides
come to my chu’ch to prayer-meetin’ last night,
an’ dey got in a fight at de door of de meetin’-house!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dey oughter be churched!” Skeeter exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dey would hab been churched, only I agonized
wid ’em an’ got ’em to bury de hatchet. But I
ain’t runnin’ no risks. Dey buried de hatchet,
but dey left de handle stickin’ out!”</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_233'></a>“Dat’s bad news, Rev’un,” Skeeter sighed. “Dis
here am de official headquarters of bofe sides.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Bad luck, Skeeter!” Vinegar bellowed as he
started toward the door. “You better hang a
piece of black crape on de Hen-Scratch door and
go fishin’ wid me. Dem niggers will shore rough-house
you when dey git started, an’ you’ll be same
as dead.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Vinegar departed, leaving uneasiness and anxiety
where confidence had been.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the evening, the saloon rapidly filled with
negroes who came in from the country. They
were all hardy men, with muscles of oak and iron—one-shirt,
one-gallus fellows of the baser sort, who
despised the colored man who lived in town, wore
a derby hat, sported a high collar, and was stuck
up. These were all sullen and devoted adherents
of Pap Curtain, and after listening for a while to
their bitter anarchistic talk, Figger Bush became
frightened of his own supporters and wished
there was some easy and unostentatious way to
resign.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dem fellers is rambunctious,” he whispered
fearfully to his partner. “Dey comes at eve’ything
butt-end fust an’ hits it wid a jolt. I wish
I hadn’t never et outen de same spoon wid ’em.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Don’t stir ’em up too much, Figger,” Skeeter
urged him. “Mebbe when some of my gang
comes in dey’ll calm down a little.”</p>

<p class='c005'>But Skeeter found that when a bull is mad the
<a id='Page_234'></a>sight of another bull does not calm his spirit; it
rouses him to battle.</p>

<p class='c005'>A number of town negroes drifted in, took a
look at the situation, and drifted quietly out.
They had counted the number of Pap’s adherents
and had gone for reënforcements, for the saloon
was soon filled with men who were loud in their
praise of Mustard Prophet, and they outnumbered
Pap’s followers three to one.</p>

<p class='c005'>Pap’s crowd, dusty, ragged, trampish-looking,
drew off at one end of the saloon and composed
a little, sour, ugly bunch; over against the more
dressy Tickfall bunch, they were a sad contrast,
and they felt it.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then Pap Curtain entered the scene, and his
followers took heart.</p>

<p class='c005'>Pap was practicing the political trick of looking
like he belonged to the great common people, and
had come up from the commonest of them all. He
was a grave-digger and well-digger by profession,
and he looked to-night like he had just finished the
job of digging all the graves and wells that would
be needed in Tickfall Parish for many years to
come. There was fresh clay on his clothes and
hat and shoes; clay streaked his yellow baboon
face, and was plastered thick upon his horny
hands. He joined his bunch with many noisy
greetings and much hand-shakings, and glared
over at the town crowd with every manifestation
of contempt that he could devise.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_235'></a>Mustard Prophet came in and joined the town
crowd. He was a good-natured, easy-smiling,
hard-working negro who had the confidence and
esteem of all the people in the town, white and
black. Yet he was a real country negro, who had
never lived in Tickfall in his life, while Pap had
spent many years in Tickfall and owned his cabin
there.</p>

<p class='c005'>Smilingly, Mustard turned to Skeeter, and said,
loud enough for everyone to hear:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Less git dese here obsequies started, Skeeter.
What am de plogram?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I ain’t fixed up no special diagram,” Skeeter
muttered. “Mebbe we mought start somepin off
ef bofe de leadin’ candidates made a speech.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Let ’em speech!” a number of voices exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Brudders, I introduces Pap Curtain,” Skeeter
announced. “He’s runnin’ fer presidunt of de
Uplift. We axes him to say de fust words.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I ain’t used to speakin’ ’thout I kin cuss,” Pap
Curtain began, in his snarly voice, gazing at the
Prophet aggregation with contemptuous eyes and
sneering lips. “When I sees a lot of dude niggers
tryin’ to ack like Gawd made a mistake when He
didn’t make ’em white, I don’t cuss, because I ain’t
able to do the subjeck jestice. I thanks de good
Lawd dat I ain’t nothin’ but a corn-fiel’ nigger,
brudder of de cotton-fiel’ mule, an’ I makes my
livin’ diggin’ wells, ditches, an’ graves. I done
dug de graves of all de dead, an’ now I’s gittin’
<a id='Page_236'></a>ready to dig de graves of some dat’s livin’. We
corn-fiel’ niggers will bury Mustard Prophet an’
his Tickfall dudes when de day of votin’ comes!”</p>

<p class='c005'>A sullen note of applause came from Pap’s ugly-looking
crowd, but there was no enthusiasm, no
good-will. In a word, Pap’s crowd were not good
sportsmen. One man took a big red apple out of
his pocket, wiped it off on the leg of his trousers
and began to eat it.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I now introduces Mustard Prophet,” Skeeter
announced uneasily.</p>

<p class='c005'>There was handclapping, several shouts of applause.
Mustard’s crowd had been trained in the
lodges and the various clubs and knew a little better
how to act under the circumstances.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I don’t see no reason fer gittin’ sour an’ ugly,
brudders,” Mustard began. “Nobody ain’t gwine
lose much ef he don’t git elected presidunt of de
league. In de last year I ain’t got nothin’ fer my
presidunt job but a cuss-word eve’y time I do
somepin dat don’t please nobody. Of co’se I
wants to keep on wid dis job an’ hopes you won’t
fergit to vote fer me. Pap Curtain says he’s a
corn-fiel’, cotton-fiel’ nigger, but dar ain’t no man,
white ner black, dat ever seed him wuckin’ in no
kind of fiel’ as a country nigger oughter do. He
lives in dis town, an’ he owns his house in dis town.
As you-all knows, I’s a real country nigger, never
did live in town, an’ I been de overseer of Marse
Tom’s plantation fer twenty year. I tries to
<a id='Page_237'></a>stand by de high notions of de Uplift. I preaches
dat a feller ought to dress up in work clothes when
he wucks, an’ put on his compan’y clothes when
he goes out in sawciety, an’ wear his Sunday
clothes at de lodge an’ de fun’ral an’ de meetin’-house——”</p>

<p class='c005'>At this point the apple-eating adherent of Pap
Curtain had consumed his apple to the core. He
balanced it on his thumb as a child prepares to
shoot a marble, and flicked it across the room,
where it landed on the top of Mustard Prophet’s
bald head.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mustard Prophet stepped down from the chair
on which he was standing, walked quietly across
the room, laid hold of the collar of the offender,
kicked his shins, punched his jaw, then turned him
around and booted him across the room.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was no more than the offender deserved, but
he offered all the resistance and counter-offensive
in his power, and while this was going on someone
slipped behind Mustard and administered a lusty
and soul-satisfying kick to him.</p>

<p class='c005'>The notion became contagious. The two forces
joined in combat, but, strange to say, they did not
fight with fists, but with feet.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Look at dat!” Little Bit exclaimed, as he
scrambled to a safe place on the top of the bar,
where he danced up and down in his high-heeled
pumps. “Eve’ybody is tryin’ to kick eve’ybody
else!”</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_238'></a>In a moment the crowd was so cramped for
room that they had to abandon that mode of combat
and began to fight with their fists. They
milled around and around, pounding, scrouging,
punching with elbows, while their voices rose in a
mighty diaphony of imprecation and abuse.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Lawd! Lawd!” Little Bit exclaimed in a
prayerful voice from his place of safety on the bar.
“Eve’ybody is tryin’ to hit eve’ybody else!”</p>

<p class='c005'>In the fury of battle the men sought other
weapons and found the numerous chairs most convenient.
In the jam they found it impossible to
swing the chairs and hit with them, so they held
the chairs before them, as a lion-tamer does, and
charged their opponents, holding their heads low
to avoid being clubbed. The resemblance to a lot
of milling, horning cattle struck Little Bit at once,
and from his vantage-point upon the bar he announced
the procedure:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Eve’y bully is tryin’ to hook eve’ybody
else!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Skeeter Butts had seen as much of the fray as
he could stand, so he ran behind the bar, seized
his automatic pistol and fired it in the air, holding
the weapon out of the window. He knew how
dangerous such a performance was, for it might
suggest to the angry negroes the use of their own
guns. But he took the chance with the hope that
the town watchman would hear the firing and come
to the rescue.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_239'></a>The negroes took no notice of the pistol-firing,
for some of them had found new and mightier
weapons. There were half a dozen tables in the
room, and when some of these were overturned,
the men wrenched the legs off, and with shouts of
glee brought these mighty clubs into action.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Gawdlemighty!” Little Bit screamed. “Eve’ybody
is tryin’ to kill eve’ybody else!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Figger rushed to the electric-switch and turned
off the lights.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Bless Gawd!” Little Bit bawled. “Eve’ybody
cain’t see eve’ybody else!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Suddenly a voice cut through the sound and
fury of that room.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Hey, you niggers! Turn on the lights!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Silence except for the tramping of many feet
going toward doors and windows.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Halt!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Silence, broken by the sound of running feet.
The light flashed on and Little Bit stood by the
switch.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dey’s all went, cap’n,” he snickered. “Nobody
here excusin’ me!”</p>

<p class='c005'>The watchman pushed open the swinging door
and passed out into the night.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I guess de meetin’ is over,” Little Bit giggled.
“I’ll shet up an’ go home to bed.”</p>

<p class='c005'>He carefully examined his garments to see that
they had not been hurt in the scramble, smoothing
his flowered shirt-waist shirt, and pulling up his
<a id='Page_240'></a>purple-silk stockings till they were trim and neat
over his legs.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’m glad dem scufflers didn’t spile my ladylike
clothes,” he said proudly. “Ginny Babe Chew
says I’s de sensation of de town!”</p>
<h3 class='c010'>V</h3>

<p class='c011'>During the night there was an exodus from
Tickfall on the part of certain citizens.</p>

<p class='c005'>Skeeter Butts and Figger Bush left for the fishing-camp,
where Vinegar Atts had taken refuge.
They found Pap Curtain and Mustard Prophet
sitting in front of a camp-fire, telling the pastor of
the Shoofly church the story of their rival race for
president of the Uplift League.</p>

<p class='c005'>The place of assembly was known as the Buzzard’s
Roost, a camp hidden deep in the Little
Moccasin Swamp on the banks of the Dorfoche
Bayou. During the next day, their company was
augmented by various negroes who nursed wounds
and bruises acquired in the affray in the saloon.
But they were all fugitives—and friends now.</p>

<p class='c005'>Followers of Pap Curtain and followers of Mustard
Prophet dug bait and cut poles and rigged
up fishing-lines and entered into friendly piscatorial
rivalry and forgot all about the elevation
of the poor, oppressed colored race. Ten days
passed in a happy vacation for the whole care-free
bunch.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_241'></a>Then Little Bit made his appearance at the
Buzzard’s Roost with an important announcement:</p>

<p class='c005'>“You won’t git arrested ef you comes in now,
brudders. De police is done fergot all about you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Whut’s de good news in Tickfall, Little Bit?”
Skeeter inquired.</p>

<p class='c005'>“De election is done winned,” Little Bit told
him.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Who am presidunt?” Mustard Prophet asked
hopefully.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ginny Babe Chew.”</p>

<p class='c005'>A low moan of sorrow came from the throats of
the crowd.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, suh,” Little Bit continued. “De Uplift
League met an’ called a election immediate, an’
Ginny got all de votes.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Who else wus ’lected?” Figger asked.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Me!” Little Bit grinned proudly. “I was
’lected fust high janitor at four dollars per mont’
pay. I’m de only man whut got a job. De lady
folks took a look at dese here ladylike clothes an’
dey ’lected me unanermous.”</p>

<p class='c005'>There was silence for quite a while. Then
Skeeter asked:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Is de Hen-Scratch pretty much busted up,
Little Bit?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Naw. ’Tain’t hurt any. I nailed de legs on
de tables an’ patched up de broke chairs an’ us is
jes’ as good off as ever.”</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_242'></a>Skeeter glanced toward his automobile and rose
to his feet.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’s gwine back to town, niggers!” he announced.
“You-all kin foller. De fust drink in
de Hen-Scratch is a free-fer-all on me!”</p>

<p class='c005'>A shout of applause greeted this.</p>

<p class='c005'>“But listen, fellers,” Skeeter said earnestly.
“From dis time on, as fer as I’m concerned, pol’tics
is nix!”</p>

<h3 class='c010'>I</h3>

<p class='c011'>There were two men in Tickfall to whom everybody
came with their troubles—Vinegar Atts,
pastor of the Shoofly church, and Skeeter Butts,
proprietor of the Hen-Scratch saloon. Both were
reputed among their fellows to be wise in all human
experience and equal to every emergency of life
upon the earth.</p>

<p class='c005'>Generally a man in trouble went first to Vinegar
Atts, after which he poured his tale into the ear
of Skeeter Butts. Each of these modern solons
gave the troubled one some expert advice; then
the preacher and the barkeeper got together and
held a consultation, in which, as in a consultation
of physicians, the diagnosis of each was confirmed,
but the treatment was changed.</p>

<p class='c005'>This time it was Shin Bone in trouble. Shin
was the proprietor of a hot-cat eating-house, which
made him and his wife very popular in the community,
for there seems to be a natural affinity
between a colored person and a piece of fried
catfish.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_244'></a>“Whut ails yo’ mind, Shin?” Vinegar asked as
Shin sat down on the cabin porch, dropping his
old wool hat at his feet.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’s in deep troubles,” Shin said sorrowfully.</p>

<p class='c005'>“A nigger’s trouble is like de rainbow—’tain’t
got no end,” Vinegar philosophized. “But I
don’t turn no nigger friend down because his
troubles won’t terminate. I’s willin’ to he’p you
fer any amount up to one dollar.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“’Tain’t money troubles,” Shin said. “My
bizzness is doin’ fine, but I ain’t gittin’ along so
powerful good in my fambly.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You ain’t got no fambly, excusin’ Whiffle an’
yo’ baby,” Vinegar observed.</p>

<p class='c005'>“De baby is all right,” Shin explained; “but
Whiffle ain’t doin’ so well.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Vinegar sat for a while in an expectant attitude,
waiting for Shin to go on with the narration; but
Shin found it hard to tell what he had come to say.
He made several abortive efforts to get his mouth
to going which got no further than a wretched
silence and made him look like an idiot.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well?” Vinegar bellowed. “Why don’t you
say somepin? You ack like one of dese here deef
an’ dumb mutes celebratin’ de Fo’th of July wis
noiseless powder.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“My ailment is dis,” Shin said desperately,
speaking the words in a rush, as if in a hurry to get
the confession over. “My wife, Whiffle, is payin’
entirely too much attention to yuther nigger men.”</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_245'></a>Vinegar drew a corncob pipe from his pocket
and took a long time to light it, while his attention
seemed to be concentrated upon a row of dead
trees whose snaggy branches were visible on the
Little Mocassin Ridge, four miles away.</p>

<p class='c005'>Shin fidgeted and twiddled his thumbs. Finally
he reached down at his feet for his wool hat, and
began to gnaw at its brim, as if he were starving to
death. He had chewed nearly around the circuit
of the brim before Vinegar took his eyes off the
old dead trees; and even then Vinegar merely
looked at him and said nothing.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, suh,” Shin continued, finding it easier to
talk now that he had made a start. “I always
believed dat Whiffle wus jes’ as good frien’ to me
as a wife nachelly gits to be, but now I done
changed my mind.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Who is de man whut runs atter her?” Vinegar
asked.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I don’t know, an’ I cain’t find out,” Shin responded.
“Of co’se, no nigger man ain’t gwine
come to see her when I’m hangin’ aroun’. Whoever
is courtin’ Whiffle comes to de back door of
de resteraw when I’m out in town somewhar.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Mebbe it’s some of her kinnery dat has sneaked
back to town an’ ain’t hankerin’ to be perceived,
especially by de police.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It couldn’t be none like dat,” Shin replied.
“Whiffle ain’t got but one kinfolks, an’ dat wus
her brudder. Dat brudder is plumb absent fer
<a id='Page_246'></a>good an’ all. You knows whut happened to him,
don’t you?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Naw, suh,” Vinegar answered, scraping his
head with the palm of his hand to stir his recollection.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It come to pass at our weddin’,” Shin told
him. “Atter we got hitched, a passel of niggers
moseyed over to our house to wish us a fussless
married life an’ git a sasser of ice-cream an’ cake.
Us soon gobbled up our vittles, an’ I gib her brudder,
Pewter Boone, a ten-dollar bill to go git some
more eats. He went.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well?” Vinegar snapped. “Go on wid de
story.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dat’s all,” Shin responded. “As I tole you,
Pewter went. He tuck my ten dollars an’ jes’
nachelly abandoned me. He ain’t never come
back, an’ I’m got a hunch dat he’s gwine till yit.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I don’t remember when dat nigger lived in
Tickfall at all,” Vinegar said.</p>

<p class='c005'>“He didn’t live here,” Shin said impatiently.
“He got his raisin’ in N’Awleens. Jes’ dropped
in day o’ the weddin’ an’ then dropped out before
I even took time to get a good look at him. But
dat Pewter nigger ain’t got nothin’ to do wid dis.
Us is done side-tracked an’ got off de subjeck.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Whut does you want me to do?” Vinegar
asked.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Keep yo’ eye out fer me, an’ find out who dat
nigger is whut hangs aroun’ Whiffle.”</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_247'></a>“Naw, suh,” Vinegar said promptly. “I don’t
monkey wid no love scrapes. I’m a exput in givin’
religious advices, but I ain’t no mattermony-fixer.
I declines.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Who muss I take my troubles to?” Shin asked
desperately.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Tell yo’ sorrers to de barkeep,” Vinegar
chuckled. “You knows as well as I do dat Skeeter
Butts is de exput mattermony-fixer of dis town.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Shin placed his hat on his head and stood up.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I aimed to ax Skeeter, too, Rev’un, but I decided
to come to see you fust.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dat wus right,” Vinegar applauded. “I loves
to git fusters on eve’y scandal in town.”</p>
<h3 class='c010'>II</h3>

<p class='c011'>When Shin Bone revealed his trouble to Skeeter
Butts, the situation delighted the very soul of the
barkeeper.</p>

<p class='c005'>“At de fust off-startin’, my notion is dat a lot
of hongry niggers is hangin’ aroun’ yo’ kitchen beggin’
fer free vittles,” he told Shin. “Whiffle ain’t
figgerin’ on bustin’ up her happy home by runnin’
off wid some yuther nigger man. I know she ain’t
got no husbunt to brag on, but she done de best
she could at de time, an’ husbunts ain’t improved
so much dat she aims to lop you off.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Kin you kinder watch aroun’ an’ see who it is
dat’s hangin’ aroun’ de kitchen?” Shin asked.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_248'></a>“Why don’t you do yo’ own watchin’?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I cain’t git close enough to see.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Stay fur away an’ look,” Skeeter suggested.</p>

<p class='c005'>He rose, walked around the bar, and brought out
a pair of army field-glasses enclosed in a leather
case. They were handsome things. He adjusted
the lenses to his vision, handed them to Shin Bone
and indicated an old tree whose dead limbs pointed
upward like the fingers of a gnarled and twisted
hand in the Little Mocassin Swamp, three miles
away. Shin placed the glasses to his eyes and
uttered a yell of surprise.</p>

<p class='c005'>“My Lawd!” he exclaimed. “I see a red-head
woodpecker settin’ on one of dem limbs!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Suttinly,” Skeeter said. “You kin look jes’
as fur as you wants to when you look through dem
glasses.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I ain’t aimin’ to see no furder dan a suttin
nigger man,” Shin replied. “Atter I see who
Whiffle’s beau is, I expecks to git a little closer.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“How close?” Skeeter grinned.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Close enough to shoot at dat nigger six times;
an’ ef I has bad luck an’ misses wid all dem shots,
I’s gwine throw brickbats at him half an hour,”
Shin told his counselor.</p>

<p class='c005'>“All you got to do is to borrer dem glasses an’
keep yo’ eye on de kitchen.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Whar would be a good place to hide while I
watches?”</p>

<p class='c005'>In his mind, Skeeter took a survey of all the
<a id='Page_249'></a>surrounding country before he offered a suggestion.
Finally he pointed to a tree half-way across
the town, on a little hill, and said:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ef you climb up in dat tree an’ hide yo’se’f in
de leaves, I figgers dat you will hab a straight line
to look right at yo’ kitchen door. Ef I wus you,
I’d go out to dat tree right now an’ take a look wid
dese glasses.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ll shore try dat on!” Shin exclaimed. “Does
dese here glasses b’long to you?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Naw. Dey ain’t really mine, but I’ll lend you
de loant of ’em,” Skeeter said. “A feller come
to dis saloon an’ borrered some money, an’ lef’
dese here spy-glasses fer s’curity. So, of co’se,
dey is mine ontil he fetches back de money whut
he borrered.”</p>
<h3 class='c010'>III</h3>

<p class='c011'>Shin went out to the tree that Skeeter had indicated,
seated himself among the branches, and
directed his vision to the kitchen door of his restaurant.
So powerful were the lenses that it
seemed to him that the door was only ten feet
away.</p>

<p class='c005'>First appeared the Rev. Vinegar Atts. Whiffle
sat upon the steps and talked to him for some
time, much to Shin’s disgust.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dat ole fat fool said he warn’t gwine to butt
into my fambly scandal,” Shin grumbled. “I
<a id='Page_250'></a>knowed he couldn’t keep hisse’f out. He sniffs
aroun’ atter yuther people’s sins like a smell-dog!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Some minutes later he brought his glasses again
to bear upon the kitchen, and was disgusted to
find Skeeter Butts on the steps.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dat nigger oughter hab sense enough to keep
away from dar,” he grumbled. “He oughter
watch when he knows I ain’t watchin’.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Shin’s perch in the tree became very uncomfortable
before Skeeter left. Then his long waiting was
rewarded.</p>

<p class='c005'>A strange man came to the kitchen door, and
Whiffle rushed out to meet him with every manifestation
of delight. They sat down together, and
Whiffle left no doubt in the mind of her jealous,
watchful husband that she was enamored of this
new negro.</p>

<p class='c005'>For more than an hour Shin hardly took the
glasses off the man’s face. For a while he had the
idea that he had seen the visitor somewhere before,
but this impression gradually vanished.</p>

<p class='c005'>He decided that the stranger was a city negro,
because of his easy manners. His quick-moving
lips showed that he spoke readily, and he carried
himself in a way that suggested a soldier. He had
typical Ethiopian features, and was what the
negroes call “brown-skin.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dat is one of dese perch-mouthed city niggers
wid big ideas an’ small judgment,” Shin grumbled
<a id='Page_251'></a>as he climbed down from the tree. “I think I’m
done watchin’ him to-day. I’ll climb up here an’
hab a little session wid dat nigger to-morrer.”</p>

<p class='c005'>When he got back to his place of business he
found Whiffle just as she had been for several days,
bubbling over with excitement and laughter, her
nerves atingle with some great secret.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Whut ails you, Whiffle?” he growled. “You
ack like you done seen about seben angels or had
about ’leven drams. I ain’t had nothin’ to perk
me up like you is.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I don’t tell eve’ything I knows, Shinny,” she
laughed, all unconscious of the clouds of jealousy
which had gathered over him like a storm above
a mountain peak. “A nigger husbunt hadn’t
oughter know too much.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why oughtn’t dey know too much?” Shin
snapped.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Because dey’s apt to lead deir wives a dance,”
Whiffle snickered.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Huh!” Shin grunted. “I’s like a jackass—I
ain’t got no year fer music an’ no foot fer dancin’!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then he went and loaded his pistol and slipped
it into the pocket of his coat.</p>
<h3 class='c010'>IV</h3>

<p class='c011'>When Shin described to Skeeter Butts the
strange man he had seen at the kitchen door,
Skeeter evinced great surprise.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_252'></a>“Dat’s de picture of de man whut borrered some
money from me an’ gib me dem spy-glasses fer
s’curity!” Skeeter exclaimed. “You is spyin’ on
dat man wid his own spy-glasses.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ef you’ll borrer dat nigger’s pistol, I’ll shoot
him wid his own gun,” Shin said.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You git dat shootin’ notion off’n yo’ mind!”
Skeeter snapped. “Dar is bigger fish in de bayou
dan you ever fried in yo’ resteraw, an’ dar is better
nigger women in de worl’ dan dat blockhead
Whiffle gal you’s got in yo’ kitchen.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“She suits me, an’ ef anybody tries to git her
dar’s a right smart chance fer fun’rals!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Mebbe so,” Skeeter said; “but she ain’t wuth
fightin’ fer, especially when a fight will land you
in de jail-house.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Mebbe I kin think up some yuther way to
chase dat nigger out of town,” Shin said: “but
de best way I knows of now is to shoot at him till
he gits good an’ skeart, an’ den throw rocks.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dat’s de favoryte nigger way of chasin’ coons,”
Skeeter agreed; “but don’t git to shootin’ an’
throwin’ ontil I tells you to. Ef dar ain’t no better
way to disperse dat nigger, mebbe I’ll he’p you
wid a few bricks myself.”</p>

<p class='c005'>When Shin had gone, Skeeter hastened to the
restaurant and called Whiffle out.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Shin Bone is got jealous about dat new nigger
whut hangs aroun’ yo’ kitchen, Whiffle. I ain’t
know his name, but you knows him. Shin has
<a id='Page_253'></a>already cleant and oilt his gun, an’ is warmin’ up
fer activations. We don’t need no fust-class killin’
in dis town, so you better stressify to dat coon
whut is comin’ to him an’ ’suade him to git out.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Is Shin a pretty good shooter?” Whiffle asked.</p>

<p class='c005'>“He is de wuss shooter in dis town,” Skeeter
told her. “He cain’t possibly hit nothin’ but a
innercent standbyer, an’ dat would be a luck shot.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ef dat’s de case, dar ain’t no danger,” Whiffle
said easily. “He never will shoot at nobody.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“When a nigger gits jealousy, he goes crazy in
his head, an’ he’s liable to do mighty nigh anything,”
Skeeter said earnestly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ll take keer of Shinny,” Whiffle laughed.
“I’s mighty glad you tole me, so I’ll know whut
to do.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Skeeter returned to the saloon, and half an hour
later the strange negro who was owner of the field-glasses
came in.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Skeeter, I wants to gib a free show at de nigger
picnic-groun’ on de Cooley bayou dis afternoon.
I invites eve’ybody, but I ’specially wants you
an’ Vinegar Atts, an’ I would like to hab a nigger
named Shin Bone.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“How come you pick out such a crowd as dat
fer special eye-witnersers?” Skeeter asked.</p>

<p class='c005'>“A preacher, a saloon-keeper, an’ a resteraw
man,” the stranger smiled. “A bunch like dat is
able to supply all human needs.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It ’pears to me like you also needs a doctor
<a id='Page_254'></a>an’ a undertaker,” Skeeter remarked; “but of co’se
you knows yo’ own bizzness best.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You’ll know my bizzness better at de picnic-groun’,”
the stranger returned.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Us will be dar at three o’clock.”</p>
<h3 class='c010'>V</h3>

<p class='c011'>A great crowd assembled at the picnic-ground.
The three men specially invited were sitting under
a tree, smoking and waiting. The showman came
promptly on time, and shook hands with the three,
but did not offer to tell his name.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Whut name does dey call you by?” Vinegar
asked.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I ain’t got no name,” the negro grinned.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dat’s strange!” Vinegar muttered. “I’ll call
you Stranger, fer shawt.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Stranger carried a heavy sack, and he now untied
the top and poured the contents upon the ground.
There were two or three dozen marbles, such as
children use in their games; there were a dozen
or more small apples, about a dozen empty pop-bottles,
and several dozen tops of small tin cans.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’s a pistol-shooter,” the stranger announced.
“Ef you misdoubts my confession, jes’ take a
look.”</p>

<p class='c005'>He tossed an apple above his head; quickly he
tossed two more, juggling them in the air. Suddenly
from somewhere he drew a big pistol, shot
<a id='Page_255'></a>three times with startling quickness, and the
shattered apples dropped at his feet.</p>

<p class='c005'>There are men who are born with the strange
gift of demonstrating that the hand is quicker
than the eye. In civilized sections of the country
men so gifted are sleight-of-hand performers; in
other sections, less civilized, they become card-sharps,
with the ability to “pitch a good game”
and deal themselves cards from the bottom of the
deck; in still other sections, they become expert
gunmen whose skill as marksmen is a wonder to
behold.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Tickfall crowd stood breathlessly watching
the juggler of bottles, apples, marbles. He tossed
pop-bottles in the air, and while they were spinning
he shot through the neck of the bottle and
broke the bottom to pieces without injuring the
neck. He threw up the tin tops of the pop-bottles,
and unerringly shot through the center of each. He
tossed the apples into the air, and shattered them
with bullets. He threw marbles three at a time
above his head, and they came down in dust.</p>

<p class='c005'>There was one man on whom this exhibition
made a deep impression. Shin Bone had bragged
his brags about chasing that very darky out of
town by shooting at him and throwing rocks. He
now abandoned his idea. That was certainly not
the way to rid Tickfall of the presence of the
dangerous stranger.</p>

<p class='c005'>When the exhibition was over, the stranger
<a id='Page_256'></a>turned to the three men who were especially invited
and said:</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’m much obleeged to you niggers fer comin’
out to de show. I would like to walk back to
town wid you-alls, but I ain’t gwine dat way.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You shore is a shooter, brudder!” Skeeter exclaimed.
“Ef you ain’t gwine our way, us’ll see
you later.”</p>

<p class='c005'>As the three walked back to town, Shin said
thoughtfully:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Skeeter, I think you wus right when you said
not to hab no shootin’ scrape about Whiffle. De
way I feels now, ef dat Stranger nigger is gwine
shoot fer my wife, he kin jes’ take her along ’thout
no good objections from me!”</p>
<h3 class='c010'>VI</h3>

<p class='c011'>“Looky here, Skeeter,” Vinegar Atts announced,
when they got back to the Hen-Scratch
saloon. “Somepin is got to be did fer Shin Bone.
Us cain’t let dat Stranger run off wid Shin’s wife.
It’s ag’in’ conscience an’ religion.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“How we gwine chase him?” Skeeter asked,
glancing pityingly at Shin’s gloomy face. “Skeeter
cain’t think up no scheme to apply to him. He
don’t ’pear to be skeart to shoot it out wid nobody.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dar is somepin or yuther dat eve’y nigger in
de worl’ is skeart of, fellers,” Vinegar declared.
<a id='Page_257'></a>“Less find out whut dat coon’s pertickler skeer is,
an’ put it on him.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“How we gwine find out?” Shin asked.</p>

<p class='c005'>There was no answer to this inquiry, and the
three sat silent for a long time, smoking their pipes
in gloomy meditation. At last Vinegar sprang to
his feet with a yell.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I got it!” he howled. “A nigger is skeart of
anything dat he don’t know nothin’ about. Dead
folks, pest-houses, ha’nts, bein’ all by yo’ lonely in
de dark, hospitals—niggers is skeart of all dem
things, because us don’t know nothin’ about ’em.
You cain’t ax none of dem things a decent question
an’ git a respeckful respondence.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Whut is dat Stranger nigger igernunt about?”
Shin asked, his eyes gleaming with hope.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Pigs!” Vinegar howled. “Is you niggers done
fergot dat Marse Tom pulls off his big pig drive
to-morrer?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dat don’t he’p us none,” Skeeter said disdainfully.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It do!” Vinegar declared. “Us’ll git Marse
Tom to put dat exput-shootin’ nigger at de
shootin’-post, an’ when he sees dem wild pigs
swoopin’ down on him, he’ll jes’ nachelly sprout a
couple o’ feathers an’ fly away from dar. Dem
hawgs will run him plumb to de Gulf of Mexico.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I gitcher!” Skeeter exclaimed. “Yo’ mind is
suttinly popped off a noble idear. Less go see
Marse Tom.”</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_258'></a>The most interesting event of the year in Tickfall
is the wild-hog hunt. Gaitskill owned the
Little Moccasin Swamp, and he had let hundreds
of hogs run wild in that jungle and shift for themselves.
They lived on the mast and traversed the
forest in bands of a hundred or more. They never
fattened, being of the razorback variety; but they
furnished plenty of cheap pork every year for the
hundreds of negroes employed on the Gaitskill
plantations.</p>

<p class='c005'>The weather was cool, and the time had come
for the fall drive. There had been no rain for
months, the swamp was dry underfoot, and a great
picnic crowd assembled from all over the Parish.</p>

<p class='c005'>Hundreds of men and hundreds of dogs spread
out across the swamp, fan-shape, making every sort
of a noise that would drive the hogs before them
to a point near the Gaitskill hog camp. Here
Little Moccasin Lake upon one side and Alligator
Lake upon the other were divided by a narrow
ridge of land, where the slaughter of the animals
would take place.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the slaughter of the hogs care was exercised
not to kill the big fighting males. They were
the leaders of the herd, and when they led in a
fight for the protection of the females or the young,
everything cleared out of their path as before the
onrush of an express train. The females were
also protected. The young male hogs were slain,
their flesh being tender and easily made into hams,
<a id='Page_259'></a>bacon, and salt shoulders for food on the plantation.</p>

<p class='c005'>This is one of the most dangerous games ever
played in the Little Moccasin Swamp. Some of
the big male hogs are six feet long and four feet
high. They travel with the speed of a race-horse,
and have the fighting instincts of a tiger. From
their lower jaws great, ugly tusks protrude. They
can run at full speed past a horse, and by an upward
thrust of that lower jaw can split the flesh
of the animal’s leg as if cut by a razor, or disembowel
him completely.</p>

<p class='c005'>A man in the midst of a fighting herd is helpless.
When he hears an old sow pop her jaws, or sees
her coming through the underbrush with a swinish
roar, he will climb a prickly ash-tree or jump into
a vat of tar to escape.</p>

<p class='c005'>As the herd on this day was hedged in between
the lakes and driven forward, the men heard before
them, at the point where the slaughter was to
be, the <i>crack, crack</i>, of a rifle. When at last the
entire crowd had converged at the shooting-post,
they found a strange negro standing with dozens
of dead hogs around him. A dozen rifles were
resting upon the top of a stump by his side; and
as the young pigs rushed past him he raised a gun
with a careless gesture, fired with seeming indifference
but with absolute accuracy, and at each
shot a young hog rolled over with a broken neck.</p>

<p class='c005'>The men watched this exhibition of sharpshooting
<a id='Page_260'></a>with great astonishment. The marksman
never seemed to take aim, and yet never missed.
Just as a man can reach up and put his finger on
his nose, so this man could put a bullet through
the neck of a running hog and think nothing of it.</p>

<p class='c005'>In a little while nearly two hundred hogs were
waiting for the knife of the butcher. Everybody
lent a hand in the job of dressing them and loading
them into wagons for their trip back to town.</p>

<p class='c005'>Vinegar Atts, Skeeter Butts, and Shin Bone
worked together. They spent a great deal of
their time in low-toned conversation.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I figgered dem wild hawgs would chase dat nigger
off’n de top of de world,” Vinegar lamented as
he glanced malevolently toward the stranger, who
was sitting beside a stump, smoking a cigarette.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It didn’t pester him at all,” Skeeter sighed.
“He looked like he enjoyed hisse’f real good.
Reckon how come dat nigger didn’t git in de army,
when he kin fight an’ shoot so good?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“De only way to skeer dat nigger is to take his
guns away from him,” Shin remarked. “He feels
powerful secure when he’s got a gun, an’ I feels—otherwise.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Me, too,” Vinegar agreed. “An’ I bet he
sleeps wid dem guns on his pusson!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Before the day was over, the marksman had
been so loudly proclaimed by the white men for
his skill that the negroes were feeling proud of
this representative of their race and color.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_261'></a>The negro women of Tickfall had prepared a
great dinner at the hog camp. While the negroes
were eating, the distinguished stranger suddenly
left the side of Whiffle Bone and walked around
the table to where Shin Bone was standing with
Atts and Skeeter Butts.</p>

<p class='c005'>Shin saw him coming, and turned almost white.
When the stranger thrust his hand into his pocket,
Shin bleached some more; but the stranger extended
toward Shin Bone not a gun, but a ten-dollar
bill!</p>

<p class='c005'>“I owes you dis ten-dollar bill, Shinny,” he said,
loud enough for everybody to hear.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I ain’t sold you nothin’,” Shin said, shaking
his head and declining the proffered currency.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Naw, suh, but you loant me dis money a good
many year ago, when you got married,” the
stranger replied. “You bestowed dis loose change
on me to buy some ice-cream an’ cake fer yo’ weddin’,
an’ I rambled up-town an’ got in a little crap-game,
an’ dem bones didn’t fall right fer me. I
lost yo’ money, an’ I decided I better make myse’f
absent.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“My Lawd!” Shin Bone exclaimed, reaching
for the money. “Is you Whiffle’s long-lost
brudder?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Suttinly,” the gunman answered. “My name
is Pewter Boone, an’ I jes’ got back from whar we
fit de Kaiser.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Fer Gawd’s sake, how come you didn’t tell me
<a id='Page_262'></a>who you wus a whole heap sooner?” Shin exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I did tell Whiffle,” Pewter replied; “but I
wus ashamed to ’fess up to you onless I had de
money to pay you back. Soldiers of dis here
gover’mint don’t do like I done—dey is true to
deir trust. I borrered de money from Skeeter an’
gib him some spy-glasses fer s’curity, an’ waited
till I got me a job. Now I pays up an’ squares off
wid de worl’.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Colonel Tom Gaitskill came up at this moment
and announced:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Boys, Pewter Boone is the new superintendent
of the hog camp. Isaiah is too old, and I hired
Pewter to-day.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Shin Bone threw his arms around the new superintendent
and expressed his delight in vociferous
tones. Whiffle came over and joined them in the
jubilation. The news quickly spread, and all the
negroes in Tickfall welcomed the soldier.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Look here, brudder,” Vinegar Atts bellowed.
“Us niggers gib Marse Tom de recommend whut
got you de job of killin’ dem hawgs. We knowed
you could shoot ’em all right, but we didn’t expeck
you would. We figgered when you perceived dem
hawgs a comin’ through de brush, you’d skedaddle.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Huh!” Pewter grunted. “I don’t skeer so
awful easy. All dem growlin’, gruntin’ hawgs
reminded my mind of dem Bush Germuns. I jes’
nachelly craved to ’liminate ’em!”</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>The Ten-Share Horse</h2>
</div>
<h3 class='c010'>I</h3>

<p class='c011'>A white man entered the Hen-Scratch saloon
and sat down at one of the little tables. He looked
around him curiously. The glory of the Hen-Scratch
had departed. Nothing remained of the
saloon but its name. There was dust upon the
tables. The mirror behind the bar was written
all over with the unedifying literature of soft
drinks. There were no patrons in the place. A
little yellow barkeeper was wiping glasses and trying
to arrange grape-juice bottles in an enticing
array upon his shelves, glancing up from his task
at intervals to gaze into the tragic face of Abraham
Lincoln, which looked out from a fly-specked
frame hung crookedly upon the wall.</p>

<p class='c005'>Skeeter Butts laid down a bottle which contained
one of the softest of soft drinks, came from
behind the bar, and murmured politely into the
ear of the white man:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Us ain’t sellin’ no drinks to white men, boss.
Endurin’ of de barroom time, it wusn’t allowed.
De law made us hab sep’rate barrooms fer de
<a id='Page_264'></a>whites an’ blacks. Dar ain’t no saloons no mo’,
but——”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I ain’t buying drinks,” the white man answered.
“I have no money, no credit, no friends,
no business.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Escuse me fer sayin’ it, boss,” Skeeter
chuckled, “but dem is my fixes, an’ you is mighty
nigh as bad off as a nigger.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’m worse off than a nigger,” the white man
responded, and he seemed to get a lugubrious
satisfaction from a realization of the fact. “More
is expected of my race than of yours.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dat’s right,” Skeeter agreed. “Dey lets us
blacks down easy; but neither de whites nor de
blacks is up to expectations.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The white man sat for a while in deep thought.
Skeeter noticed that the top of his head was overdeveloped,
like an infant’s; that his fingers were
stained with cigarettes; that his clothes were of
good material but badly worn. He decided that
the man was an animated slosh in the desert of
total abstinence, mourning the demise of John
Barleycorn, and hopefully looking for a damp
cloud on the horizon in the shape of a blind tiger.</p>

<p class='c005'>Skeeter returned to his task of polishing glasses
and wiping his bar, the habit acquired through
twenty years of service to men who put one foot
upon the brass rail. Meantime he watched the
stranger from the corner of his eyes, and when the
silence was prolonged he became nervous and
<a id='Page_265'></a>fidgety. At last the man came to the bar and
spoke.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Can you lend me ten dollars?”</p>

<p class='c005'>In all Skeeter’s varied career no such request
had ever been uttered in his astonished ears.
Skeeter wondered if this extraordinary thing was
attributable to prohibition. Surely the old order
changeth!</p>

<p class='c005'>“I ain’t know yo’ favor or yo’ face, an’ I ain’t
met de ’quaintance of yo’ name, boss,” Skeeter
replied.</p>

<p class='c005'>“My name is Dick Nuhat,” the white man responded
promptly. “I am not altogether an
honest man, but I am a gentleman. This is a
request of one gentleman to another.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I likes to ’commodate white gentlemens, boss,”
Skeeter said uneasily; “but I ain’t got de ten dollars,
an’ so I cain’t affode to lend it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Without a word the man turned away, walked
back to the table, and sat down. Once more
there was a period of silence and deep meditation,
while a nervous colored man polished glasses and
watched the white man from the corner of his eye.
Mr. Nuhat had the trick of sitting as motionless
as a stone dog on a lawn, while even his eyes were
fixed in a stony stare, oblivious to what went on
around him and looking out across the spaces
unseeingly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dope!” Skeeter muttered to himself; but
Skeeter was wrong.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_266'></a>There was twenty minutes of this ponderous
thinking, and then the man came to Skeeter and
made a proposition.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ve got one thing I can sell, Skeeter. I rode
to town on a horse that is worth one hundred
dollars, intending to take him to Shongaloon, to
enter him in the races at the fair; but I am broke.
If you had lent me the ten dollars I would have
gone on; but now, if I went, I would have no
money to bet. So I am going to sell and go out of
the racing business.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You don’t talk like no race-hoss man to me,”
Skeeter said.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I ain’t a race-horse man,” was the reply. “I
am a scholar and a gentleman.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I ain’t got no hundred dollars,” Skeeter Butts
said next. “Dar ain’t no nigger in dis town wid
dat much money in one lump. You’ll have to sell
out to de white folks.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Couldn’t you find ten colored people who had
ten dollars each?” the white man asked. “All
ten of you can own the horse, and when you make
a win you can divide your earnings.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What kind of hoss you got?” Skeeter asked
with a new interest.</p>

<p class='c005'>“He’s a hard looker, Skeeter. He’s a hound
dog. He limps in all four feet, but not in all at the
same time, you know. He swaps from one foot
to the other. Every time he stops he goes lame
in a different foot, because he can’t remember
<a id='Page_267'></a>which foot he was limping on before. He has an
awful short memory that way. You never can
tell what foot he is going to cripple in next, and he
don’t know himself.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dat’s a kind of trick hoss,” Skeeter snickered.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Exactly,” Dick agreed. “I can make a killing
with him at every race-track, for one look at him
is aplenty. I can get all sorts of odds against
him; but don’t make any mistake, little yeller
nigger—that horse can run!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dat sounds good to me,” Skeeter replied after
a moment’s thought. “How much do I git fer
makin’ de trade?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Get nine negroes to give you ten dollars each
for the horse, and I’ll be satisfied with the ninety
dollars. That will give you a ten-dollar share in
the animal without costing you a cent.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Kin I try out de hoss an’ see if he is all right?”
Skeeter asked eagerly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Certainly.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“All right, boss,” Skeeter replied. “I’ll take
you up!”</p>
<h3 class='c010'>II</h3>

<p class='c011'>Skeeter staged his commercial transaction with
some forethought. He chose nine negroes whom
he knew to be possessed of ten dollars each, and
asked them to meet him out at the old fair-grounds.
He got Little Bit, who was the colored jockey of
Tickfall, to give the horse a try-out.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_268'></a>In appearance, the horse was all the white man
said he was, and more. He had a peculiar slinking
gait, like a limp, sometimes in one foot, then
in another. Often he seemed to be limping in all
four feet at the same time.</p>

<p class='c005'>The negroes howled in derision when Skeeter
proposed to be one of ten to buy the animal. They
examined his feet and made many comments, and
finally proposed to bet Skeeter ten dollars that he
could not tell what leg the horse would limp on the
next time he started off.</p>

<p class='c005'>But when Little Bit climbed on that horse the
negroes stopped laughing. He could run like a
jack-rabbit, and really had the jack-rabbit’s peculiar
springy, limpy gait.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dis hoss is a powerful funny pufformer,” Conko
Mukes howled; “but I puts my ten on him. He’s
a runner!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Who’s gwine take keer of dis hoss whut belongs
to us ten niggers?” Pap Curtain inquired.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ll keep him an’ feed him,” Skeeter answered.
“I kin turn him in a big pasture dat belongs to
Marse John Flournoy, an’ Marse John won’t ever
know he’s in de field. I’ll feed him Marse John’s
oats and corn, an’ dat white man won’t ever miss
it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Two hours later Skeeter returned to the Hen-Scratch
and handed Mr. Nuhat the sum of ninety
dollars.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I turned de hoss in de pasture back of de
<a id='Page_269'></a>sheriff’s house,” he volunteered. “Part of de
trade wus dat I wus to take keer of de hoss. I
reckin de tenth part dat I bought is de part whut
eats.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Would you be held responsible if anything
happened to the animal?” Nuhat asked.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not onless he choked to death,” Skeeter
laughed. “I jes’ takes keer of de eatin’ end.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’m sorry I could not go on to Shongaloon,”
the white man said quietly. “There’s a lot of
good money to be picked up betting on that horse
at the races.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“We’ll slick him up an’ git him feelin’ good an’
bet on him some ourselfs,” Skeeter said.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Don’t make him look too fit,” Nuhat warned
him. “That horse’s looks get the odds against
him. Nobody bets against something that looks
like a winner.”</p>

<p class='c005'>A few minutes later the white man bought a
package of cigarettes from Skeeter Butts, thanked
him for the sale of the horse, and walked out.</p>

<p class='c005'>Until midnight Skeeter was alone in the Hen-Scratch.
No one came in to patronize his soft-drink
emporium. The man was in the depths of
despair. His place had always been the popular
hang-out for all the plain loafers and fancy sons of
rest. Now there were none so lazy as to enter a
place which had nothing of its former attractiveness
but a name.</p>

<p class='c005'>“De niggers avoids dis place like it wus a pesthouse,”
<a id='Page_270'></a>Skeeter lamented to himself. “Ef I had
about two hundred dollars I could start me a
movin’-picture show fer colored only in dis little
house, an’ sell soft drinks on de side. Dat would
fotch de crowd back, an’ de men would bring de
lady folks, an’ I could git rid of a lot of ice-cream
combs an’ things like dat.”</p>

<p class='c005'>He smoked many cigarettes, lighting a fresh
one on the stub of each old one, trying to think
out a way to get some money for his new
enterprise.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Mebbe I could work some kind of flim-flam
wid dat hoss,” he sighed. “But I cain’t make
money very fast ef I got to ’vide up my profits by
ten.”</p>

<p class='c005'>It had never occurred to Skeeter to question the
white man’s ownership of that horse, nor his right
to dispose of it. The animal looked like just such
an old skate as a broken-down race-horse man
would own at the end of his track career. When
a horseman retires from the turf, he generally has
something like that to get rid of.</p>

<p class='c005'>Skeeter did not get to his home on Sheriff John
Flournoy’s premises until midnight. He did not
go to see his new horse until the next morning at
feeding-time.</p>

<p class='c005'>When he went to the pasture, he found that a gap
was broken in the fence and the horse was gone.</p>

<p class='c005'>“We better hunt dat hoss befo’ he gits too fur
away,” Skeeter said to himself. “I reckin he’s
<a id='Page_271'></a>gone back home; but I don’t know whar his home
is at, an’ I ain’t know which way to look fer him.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Two hours later all ten owners of the animal
were searching for him. Such a task was hopeless
at the start, for the animal could go into the swamp
in any direction around Tickfall and disappear
forever. A strange animal, like a strange man,
seldom came out of that jungle if he entered it
alone.</p>

<p class='c005'>The ten men made a circle of the town, walking
on the edge of the swamp, looking for tracks. They
were experienced in reading signs, but they could
not find a place where an animal had entered the
jungle. Concluding that the horse had kept in
some beaten path, they separated, each following
a winding trail in the great hot-house of the morass,
slimy with rusty-colored oily water, and all
acrawl with repulsive form of insect and animal
life.</p>

<p class='c005'>At noon they all met at the broken place in the
fence where the horse had escaped. The ground
was soft, and yet they could find no hoof-tracks
leading from the field to the highroad.</p>

<p class='c005'>They did not know that Dick Nuhat had tied
some cotton bagging under each hoof of his limpy
horse before he led him through the gap.</p>

<p class='c005'>About ten o’clock that night, Conko Mukes,
entered the Hen-Scratch saloon.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Skeeter, I come to git my money back,” he
said. “I done decided not to buy no race-hoss.”</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_272'></a>“You cain’t git yo’ money back,” Skeeter said.
“De white man took all our dollars wid him, an’
now our hoss done eloped away.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I don’t know no white man,” Conko Mukes
said belligerently. “I never seen no white man.
I ain’t saw nobody but you, didn’t make no trade
wid nobody but you, an’ I got a mighty shawt look
at dat hoss whut I paid my good ten dollars fer.
Now I’s lookin’ to you!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I got a mighty little look, too,” Skeeter said
placatingly. “I ain’t got a real good recollection
of whut dat hoss looked like. I ain’t real shore
I’d know him in de road ef he didn’t limp none.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I ain’t buyin’ no absent hoss,” Conko said.
“I want my money back!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But de white man is got our money,” Skeeter
explained again. “You won’t git yo’ money onless
you finds de white man; an’ he’ll be harder to
find dan de hoss. You had a look at de hoss, but
you never saw de white man whut sold it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I ain’t seem’ nobody but you,” Conko Mukes
remarked in a hard tone. “I gived you my money
an’ you tuck it, an’ you is de mighty nigh white
man whut is got to give it back!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I ain’t got no money!” Skeeter Butts wailed.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Git it!” Conko Mukes barked.</p>

<p class='c005'>With this command he drew a large pistol from
a holster under his left arm and laid it on the table
with the business end pointing toward Skeeter
Butts.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_273'></a>Skeeter turned almost white. Conko had the
reputation of having killed several men, and
Skeeter had no desire to be commemorated by the
next notch carved on the butt of his gun.</p>

<p class='c005'>He rose hastily to his feet and started toward
the little safe in the corner of the barroom. Conko
followed him, his big gun punching at a spot
between Skeeter’s shoulder blades, which turned
cold as ice from the contact of the steel. Conko
was not sure whether Skeeter was going after
money or a gun.</p>

<p class='c005'>The trembling barkeeper stooped and opened
the little door of his safe. He took out the only
ten dollars he had in the world and thrust it into
Conko’s hands.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Good-by, Skeeter,” Conko grinned. “Dat
wus a very narrer escapement fer you. I done
kilt plenty niggers fer less money!”</p>
<h3 class='c010'>III</h3>

<p class='c011'>The next day Skeeter faced bankruptcy.</p>

<p class='c005'>Conko possessed the gift of expression and liked
to talk. He exhibited the ten dollars he had secured
from Skeeter, boasted of the forcible methods
he used to extract it from the barkeeper’s roll, and
started eight others to planning how they also
could get their money back.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Rev. Vinegar Atts called early, and
brought Conko Mukes with him.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_274'></a>“I wants my money back, Skeeter!” he howled.
“Conko an’ me been talkin’ it over. He specifies
dat I kin come an’ shoot off my mouth, an’ he’ll
be handy to shoot off his gun; but I hopes dat ain’t
needful to pussuade you to do yo’ Christyum duty
an’ hand my dollars back. Ef you don’t see it dat
way, I kin do de tongue-lashin’ an’ Conko kin do
de razor-slashin’. How soon is you gwine hand
over my ten?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I ain’t got no tenner, Vinegar,” Skeeter said
nervously. “Conko will tell you dat he got my
las’ dollar.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Git some mo’ dollars!” Vinegar shouted. “Dat
hoss white man muss hab ’vided up dat money wid
you. I wants mine back!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You got to gimme time,” Skeeter said desperately.
“I’s tellin’ you de noble truth when I
says I ain’t got it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Vinegar turned around and looked at Conko
significantly. The brave fighter stepped into the
ring and shook a pugilistic fist under Skeeter’s
twitching nose.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Lawdymussy, niggers!” Skeeter wailed.
“Gimme a little time to hunt dat hoss. You
oughter trust me till I kin find him.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Us done spent a day huntin’ fer dat hoss,”
Conko said inexorably. “It didn’t git us nothin’.
Now you pay Vinegar’s money back an’ take yo’
time huntin’ dat hoss, an’ when you finds him you
will own my tenth an’ Vinegar’s tenth an’ yo’
<a id='Page_275'></a>tenth of dat hoss. Three limpy legs will b’long
to you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Skeeter made a few more feeble protests; but
when he saw that Conko was preparing to flash
the old familiar weapon, he surrendered finally.
Going to his little safe, to his cash-drawer, and
raking his pockets of every coin, he managed to
scrape together the sum required, in pitiful little
pindling amounts—ten cents here and two bits
there.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dar it am,” Skeeter lamented. “I done
squoze out my last nickel. I hopes you-alls will
take pity on me, an’ not tell nobody dat I paid
you back. De nex’ feller dat claims his money
will have to take my pants!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“He’ll either take yo’ pants or git his money
outen yo’ hide,” Conko laughed unfeelingly, as
the two men walked out of the saloon.</p>

<p class='c005'>One hour later Figger Bush and Shin Bone
entered the place and drew Skeeter off to a corner
of the room.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Us wants our money back, Skeeter!” was the
familiar greeting.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I ain’t got no money,” was Skeeter’s old lamentation.</p>

<p class='c005'>Followed a long argument, ending with threats.
Skeeter pleaded and prayed until he saw that the
two were clearing for action, and once more he
quit.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I ain’t got no money, men,” he said desperately,
<a id='Page_276'></a>throwing his arms wide in a hopeless gesture.
“Jes’ look aroun’ you an’ he’p yo’selves to
de Hen-Scratch.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I takes a fancy to dat grassyphome,” Figger
replied promptly. “I always did like free music,
an’ dat machine will sound real good in my cabin,
wid me settin’ on one side smokin’ my pipe an’
Scootie settin’ on de yuther side, dippin’ snuff.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Take it!” Skeeter wailed.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dis here slop-machine whar you draps in a
penny an’ gits out a stick of chaw-gum will go good
in my resteraw,” Shin Bone remarked.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Take it!” Skeeter lamented. “I’m a blowed-up
sucker!”</p>

<p class='c005'>After these men departed, Skeeter did not have
long to wait before another caller arrived. It was
Pap Curtain. He bit off the end of a cigar and
gazed intently into the little barkeeper’s gloomy
face.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You owes me ten dollars, Skeeter,” he began.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I knowed dat as soon as I seen you, Pap,”
Skeeter sighed. “I admits dat I owes you. I
promises to pay you as soon as I kin; but I ain’t
got de money now. Ef you’ll jes’ only go away
’thout talkin’, you’ll make me happy.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Pap took off his hat and laid it upon the table,
where they were sitting. He took his cigar from
his mouth and placed it on the table so that the
lighted end projected a little over the edge. Then
he drew a chair close to Skeeter and laid a horny
<a id='Page_277'></a>finger upon Skeeter’s knee for emphasis. Evidently
Skeeter was not to be made happy.</p>

<p class='c005'>Pap’s baboon face, with its snarling voice and
lips, carried its continual sneer. He possessed the
conversational facilities of Bildad the Shuhite.</p>

<p class='c005'>First he coaxed, wheedled, begged, and implored.
Then he argued and expounded, reviewed
and reiterated, discussed details and recapitulated,
presenting the whole matter from the broadest
possible standpoint; but he found it hard to persuade
money out of Skeeter, for the reason that
Skeeter had none. The cupboard was bare.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then he mentioned the possibility of a final and
absolute refusal on Skeeter’s part to restore the
ten dollars wrongfully acquired, and explained the
inevitable consequences. At this point he put on
what the negroes call the “’rousements,” and
yapped like a poodle. Reaching his peroration,
he found that decent language bent and broke
beneath the burden of his meaning, so he
“cussed.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I got only two boxes of seegaws in my little
show case, Pap,” Skeeter said, when the vocal
pyrotechnics subsided into a feeble splutter of hot
ashes. “Take ’em an’ git out! Dey is wuth mo’
dan ten dollars, but I gib ’em to you. Fer Gawd’s
sake git out!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Evidently Conko Mukes was waiting outside
until Pap finished. The swinging doors of the
saloon had not ceased to vibrate after Pap before
<a id='Page_278'></a>Conko pushed them wide and entered the room
with the clumsy gait of a bear.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I got four friends dat is app’inted me to colleck
fawty dollars Skeeter!” he bellowed. “Dey
promises me ten pussent per each fer my trouble
in collectin’. Dat’ll be fo’ dollars fer me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Jes’ take whutever you wants an’ call it even,”
Skeeter said in a lifeless voice. “I been agonizin’
all de mawnin’, an’ I craves to got de agony over.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I don’t want no secont-hand bar-fixtures,”
Conko laughed hoarsely. “Barrooms is gone out
of style. I wants de spot cash paid in my hand.
Gimme yo’ money or yo’ life!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You know I ain’t got no money,” Skeeter wailed.
“Cain’t you take somepin I got in dis saloom?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Naw!” Conko bawled. “I cain’t colleck no
ten pussent of no brass foot-rail or pool-table. I
wants de cash!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Up to this moment the day had been one of
great humiliation. Now began a period in which
Skeeter showed a marvelous mental versatility.</p>

<p class='c005'>There was no way for him to pay back that forty
dollars except to borrow it, and no one to borrow
from but the white folks. He had to tell a different
story to each white man in order to start the
fountain of his generosity and secure the loan.
And through the whole day of frenzied effort to
meet the demands upon him, there was the haunting
fear that the horse had wandered off and would
never be seen again.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_279'></a>Early the next morning Skeeter started out to
hunt his horse. Having bought it and paid for it,
he wanted it. His search was futile, and when he
returned to Shin Bone’s restaurant for his noonday
meal he was loud in his protestations of woe.</p>

<p class='c005'>“De white man whut sold you dat hoss went to
de pasture an’ stole him out an’ tuck him away,”
Shin Bone told him. “Instid of huntin’ dat hoss,
you oughter git de sheriff on de trail of dat white
man.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But de fence wus broke down,” Skeeter protested
stupidly. “Dat shows dat de hoss got out
by hisself.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ef I wus gwine steal a hoss, I’d break down de
fence so de folks would think de hoss got out,” was
the reply.</p>

<p class='c005'>This was a new idea to Skeeter, who really had
not given much thought to his predicament. He
carried this dark suspicion for the rest of the day,
still hunting his horse, but devoid of all hope of
finding it.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dat white man rode dat hoss to town, sold
him to me, an’ rode him out of town,” he sighed
pitiably. “Yet dat feller looked to me like a tollable
nice man. He stressified dat he warn’t
honest, but he specified dat he was a puffeck
gentlemun. I ain’t never gwine he’p a white man
agin!”</p>

<p class='c005'>He thought of the forty dollars he had borrowed
from the white folks and had to pay back. The
<a id='Page_280'></a>profits from his little business were extremely small
and growing less. The repayment of the borrowed
money meant close economy for a long time.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I feels powerful sorry fer myself,” he wailed.</p>

<p class='c005'>Wronged, abused, depressed, and hopeless, he
returned to the Hen-Scratch saloon. When he
entered he gasped for breath.</p>

<p class='c005'>Dick Nuhat was sitting at one of the little tables,
in an attitude of deep and solemn meditation, as
motionless as a stone dog.</p>
<h3 class='c010'>IV</h3>

<p class='c011'>Skeeter sat down at the same table and opened
his mouth to deliver his mind of all its burden of
trouble; but the white man put such a successful
cloture on the colored man’s oratory that Skeeter
could not speak a word for a long time.</p>

<p class='c005'>Nuhat thrust both hands into his pockets and
brought them out full of silver and currency. He
did not speak a word of greeting. He merely laid
the money on the top of the table and watched
Skeeter’s popping eyes.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You ought to have been at the races, Skeeter,”
Nuhat said at last. “We mopped up!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Skeeter needed no proof of this beyond the tabletop
covered with money; but even yet he could
not find a word to say.</p>

<p class='c005'>“There is over six hundred dollars of it that says
we win, Skeeter,” Nuhat laughed.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_281'></a>“Whut hoss win?” Skeeter asked with stiff
lips.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Your horse,” Nuhat replied. “Don’t you remember
that you bought a horse? Your ten-share
nigger horse that I sold you. I sneaked him
out of the pasture, took him to Shongaloon to the
races, and mopped up this money.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I been huntin’ fer dat hoss eve’ywhar,” Skeeter
sighed. “I shore missed him. I’s had a lot of
trouble ’bout dat hoss!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You won’t ever see him again,” Nuhat responded.</p>

<p class='c005'>“How come?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Nuhat hesitated a minute, looking sharply at
Skeeter. He seemed undecided what to say in
reply, but finally ventured:</p>

<p class='c005'>“I didn’t own that horse in the first place. That
horse’s real name is Springer, and its real owner is
Old Griff.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Skeeter opened his eyes until they were like
china door-knobs. He wondered why he had not
recognized the most famous race-horse in Louisiana,
named Springer because of his peculiar
springy gait.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I borrowed Springer from Old Griff’s stable
without requesting the loan of him,” Nuhat continued.
“Old Griff came to Shongaloon after
him. He was real nice about it, after I had talked
to him about four hours. At first he wanted to
put me in jail for horse-stealing.”</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_282'></a>“My Lawd, white man!” Skeeter ranted. “Dat
wus a awful risky thing to do. Glory to gracious!
To think dat a nigger like me one time owned
three-tenths of Springer—fo’-tenths—my Lawd, I
owned all of him, fer dem niggers made me give
deir money back!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That’s some glory for you, Skeeter!” Nuhat
assured him.</p>

<p class='c005'>“How come dat Old Griff didn’t put you in de
jail-house?” the colored man asked.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I had four quarts of prime Kentucky whisky
when I started in this adventure. I took it with
me to placate Old Griff when he caught me with
the goods. It worked. Toward the end of the
second quart he offered to make me a present of
the horse.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You means to say all dis money is yourn?”
Skeeter asked, waving his hand over the table.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It’s ours,” Nuhat replied. “I came back to
whack up even with you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Bless Gawd fer a noble white man!” Skeeter
exclaimed. “How come you tuck a notion to
come back here to me?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I might have kept on traveling,” the white
man said meditatively, choosing his words cautiously;
“but I wanted to have friends in Tickfall
in case Old Griff sobered up and began to trail his
horse and ask questions along the way. Besides,
down at the bottom of me, I’m honest, or want
to be.”</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_283'></a>He counted out ninety dollars and handed it to
Skeeter.</p>

<p class='c005'>“This don’t go into the divide,” he explained.
“This is the sum you originally invested in our
business enterprise. The rest is ours—not honestly
acquired, perhaps; but I was up against it, and
had to have some coin.”</p>

<p class='c005'>They had five hundred and forty dollars to divide
between them. When Skeeter sat fondling two hundred
and seventy dollars, Nuhat asked with a smile:</p>

<p class='c005'>“What you going to do with your money?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Skeeter took a big breath and sighed in happy
anticipation.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I leaves on de midnight train fer N’Awleens, an’
I stays dar till I gits dis money well spent. I’ll see
de nigger shows, ride on all de street-cars, eat hot
roasted peanuts, travel up ’n’ down on de yellervators,
chaw beefsteak two inches thick, an’ buy me a
derby hat an’ a suit of clothes wid so many colors
dat when I walks up Canal Street de white folks
will think de lightning done struck de rainbow!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’m going to buy a steamboat,” Nuhat said
musingly. “Thirty feet long, eighteen feet wide,
floating on top of the water like a cigar-box, propelled
by a paddle-wheel about as big as a barrel,
with a little donkey six-snort-power engine. It
has a speed of six miles an hour down-stream, if
the current is good. Going up-stream, it gets
there when it can.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Huh!” Skeeter grunted.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_284'></a>“It costs two hundred dollars,” Nuhat continued.
“I expect to live and die on that boat.
I love to sit and think!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ain’t you gwine do nothing but think?” Skeeter
asked, to whom such an occupation was utterly
foreign and beyond his comprehension.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes—I’m going to turn honest. Everybody
will know me as a good white man.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“White folks is diffunt from niggers in deir
notions of havin’ fun,” Skeeter said meditatively.
“Turnin’ honest an’ thinkin’ don’t look like a
awful good time to me!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I understand,” Nuhat replied. “A negro has
a one-cylinder mind and a smoky spark-plug.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But dat good time I plans don’t sep’rate me
from mo’ dan fifty dollars of my money,” Skeeter
proclaimed. “De rest goes todes startin’ me in
de movie bizness. De nex’ time you steals a hoss
an’ rides through Tickfall, you’ll see Skeeter in
charge of a fust-rate nigger movin’-picture show.”</p>

<p class='c005'>When the midnight train arrived, Skeeter was
on the platform, bidding good-by to Tickfall with
a happy face.</p>

<p class='c005'>The news of his sudden rise to prosperity had
spread with amazing rapidity through the colored
portions of the town. No one knew the details,
but all heard that the horse Skeeter bought had
won a fortune at the races. Nine men were sorely
distressed that they had treated Skeeter so shabbily
and had disposed of their shares of the horse.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_285'></a>Just as the train started, nine negroes came
running across the station platform. Pap Curtain
was waving two boxes of cigars, Figger Bush
was wildly gesticulating with the horn of his
“grassyphome,” and the others were holding
out their hands with money.</p>

<p class='c005'>Conko Mukes ran along the station platform,
clinging to the steps of the moving train, waving
a ten-dollar bill, and speaking in pleading tones.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I wants to buy my share of dat hoss agin,
Skeeter!”</p>

<p class='c005'>The train was gaining headway, and Skeeter
leaned over, pretending he could not hear what
was said.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I wants to buy my share of de hoss back!”
Conko bellowed, for he had to run now to keep up
with the moving train.</p>

<p class='c005'>Skeeter grasped the hand-rail on each side of
him and kicked out with all the strength of his
body.</p>

<p class='c005'>The toe of his boot struck Conko Mukes on the
point of the chin. The man staggered, stumbled,
and fell as a rotten log falls in the forest. Eight
of his friends stubbed their toes on him, stepped
on him, fell on him, then picked him up, brushed
off his clothes, and led him away.</p>

<p class='c005'>The train moved through the darkness like a
long serpent with shining, jeweled sides. Skeeter
entered the car and sat down, smiling.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>A Chariot of Fire</h2>

<h3 class='c010'>I<br /> <br />SKY PILOT</h3>

<p class='c011'>The man traveling through the Louisiana
swamps is often appalled by the deathlike stillness
of the woods.</p>

<p class='c005'>Slimy creatures crawl in the muck under his
feet without a croak or hiss. Gaudy birds fly from
living trees to dead, gaunt stumps without a note
of music. The fox and wolf which sometimes
make the woods vocal with their barking, slink
away at the approach of man in silence. The
whole place seems to be engaged in the deepest
conspiracy to accomplish something which the
slightest sound would disturb or frustrate.</p>

<p class='c005'>Generally, a negro walking through the woods
alone will bawl a song at the top of his voice. For
some reason he feels that there is safety in
sound, just as the Chinaman beats a tin pan to
chase the devil away. But no negro ever has the
courage to shatter one of these conspiracies of
silence when he finds it in the swamp. If everything
<a id='Page_287'></a>else begins to make a racket, he will, too.
But he won’t start anything.</p>

<p class='c005'>Which accounts for the fact that two negroes,
not two hundred yards apart, were walking
through the Little Moccasin Swamp, and were
unaware of each other’s presence.</p>

<p class='c005'>One negro was troubled. He stopped, removed
his high silk hat, and mopped the sweat from the
top of his bald head. He lowered his head and
listened, then he raised his head and listened. For
a moment he thought he heard something, then
he found the silence more intense than ever.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dar’s somepin gittin’ ready to happen aroun’
dis woods,” he whispered to himself. “I been
listenin’ in dese here swamps all my life, but I ain’t
never heard no sound like dat ontil now.”</p>

<p class='c005'>He squatted behind a stump and peered anxiously
about him. Great trees of the primeval
forest reared themselves above him, skirted and
frocked like a Druid priest with the funereal moss.
Under the wide-spreading branches of these trees
long corridors ran in every direction like the floral
avenues through some giant hot-house conservatory.
Nothing moved, no sound could be heard
under those majestic arches of the forest.</p>

<p class='c005'>The negro stooped and placed his ear to the
ground. He had heard an express train at a long
distance, and the sound he was hearing at intervals
was something like that. But he knew it was
twenty miles to the nearest railroad which carried
<a id='Page_288'></a>a train which could travel fast enough to make a
similar sound. He had also heard a wolf-pack
coming through the forest on one occasion, and
that <i>pad-pad-pad</i> of their flying feet was not dissimilar
in sound to what he was hearing. He was
also familiar with the herds of wild hogs which infested
the Little Moccasin, and when they were
moving rapidly at a long distance the sound would
be like the persistent thrumming he could dimly
hear.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Whutever dat is, ’tain’t hittin’ de groun’ wid
its foots,” he announced to himself, as he glanced
up about him with fear-shot eyes. “Dis here
nigger is gittin’ ready to vacate hisself from dis
swamp.”</p>

<p class='c005'>He glanced up at the sky. It was as clear as a
soap bubble. The haze of the evening was settling
upon the tree-tops like a vail of purple and gold
under the setting sun. He was looking for the
signs of the sudden storms which blow in from the
Gulf, and he sniffed the air for the odor of smoke
from a forest fire.</p>

<p class='c005'>“’Tain’t no fire, an’ it ain’t no cycaloon storm,”
he muttered.</p>

<p class='c005'>He turned and walked rapidly down the little
foot-path, still listening, but now more interested
in getting out of the darkening woods than in locating
the source of the sound. Suddenly he heard
the noise so loud and distinct that his next guess
was nearer than he dreamed.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_289'></a>“Dat’s a automobile engyne!” he chattered,
the goose-flesh rising all over his body. Then he
shook his head in mute denial of his assertion.
The nearest public highroad was ten miles away.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not even a skeart nigger preacher kin hear
ten miles,” he muttered. “An’ nobody but de
debbil could run a automobile in dese here woods
whar dar ain’t no road!”</p>

<p class='c005'>The thought brought him to a quick halt. Suppose
the devil were loose in these woods, riding
around in a flivver or straddle of a motor-cycle,
seeking whom he might devour?</p>

<p class='c005'>“I don’t crave to meet de debbil,” the colored
clergyman murmured, as he reached up for his
stove-pipe hat and grasped it firmly in his fingers.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I done slanderized the debbil too frequent in
my sermonts!”</p>

<p class='c005'>He turned his face until his eyes looked straight
into the face of the setting sun, and he began to
leave the scenery of the swamp behind him. He
did not run. No man can run as fast as the Rev.
Vinegar Atts was traveling.</p>

<p class='c005'>And Vinegar knew where he was going. In
the very heart of that Little Moccasin Swamp
was the Moccasin prairie. It was an open space
containing nearly a square mile of ground without
a tree or stump. It was completely surrounded
by water, and two years before a raging forest
fire had left it a charred ground strewn with ash
and soot. Now it was covered with grass and was
<a id='Page_290'></a>as smooth as a baseball diamond. Vinegar was
including that open space in his route toward Tickfall
because he could travel across it with ease and
speed.</p>

<p class='c005'>Suddenly every winged creature of the swamp
broke the silence and became vocal with screams
of fright. Hundreds of wild pigeons rose in the
air and began to describe mad circles over the head
of the running negro. From all the watercourses
rose the wild fowls that love the low, damp
marshes, and they sailed upward with hoarse
shrieks of fear. The angry, fighting, bark-like call
of the hawks, mingled with the scream of eagles,
and these fearless birds sailed straight into the
glowing red eye of the sun to meet the peril that
was coming.</p>

<p class='c005'>Vinegar Atts could not see because he was
blinded by the sun. But soon a roar sounded
above him like the exhaust of an automobile, and
Vinegar looked up.</p>

<p class='c005'>An airplane was climbing the pathless air in
long, spiral flight directly over his head—the first
flying-machine that the Rev. Vinegar Atts had
ever seen. Its long wings were tipped as with fire
by the rays of the setting sun. Beneath it the
screaming birds sailed wildly, madly, performing
all sorts of aerial stunts.</p>

<p class='c005'>Vinegar dropped on his knees, with his arms
stretched up toward the graceful creation of man’s
brain and hands. A few phrases from his old,
<a id='Page_291'></a>worn Bible came to his mind, and he bellowed them
at the top of his voice, as he listened to the exhaust
of that great motor.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Like de noise of chariots on de top of mountains,
like de noise of a flame of fire dat devoureth
de stubble—all faces shall gather blackness—dey
shall run like mighty men——”</p>

<p class='c005'>The birds scattered far and wide over the swamp.
There was a great silence. Vinegar opened his
eyes, and lo, the airplane was sailing slowly downward.</p>

<p class='c005'>“My Gawd!” Vinegar howled. “De chariot
of fire!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Thereupon he fulfilled the prophecy of the Book
of Joel, and rose from the ground and “ran like a
mighty man.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The airplane settled upon the edge of the Moccasin
prairie. A young man dismounted from the
machine, glanced at it critically, then took a survey
of the sky with a rather furtive eye, and turned with
an air of decision and disappeared in the swamp.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then a strange negro stepped to the edge of the
clearing, waited until he was sure that the airman
was not going to return, and walked over to the
machine.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dat white man is done got enough flyin’ an’
he’s drapped dis car down here fer good,” he decided.
“Dis am four miles from Tickfall, an’ ef
dat white man had wanted to land anywise nigh
he could hab done it.”</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_292'></a>He stood scratching his head and pondering.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Naw, suh,” he concluded. “Dat white man
is done lost dis here flyin’-machine. He lost it a
puppus. He ain’t never comin’ back fer it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Sniffing at the taint of hot oil which spoiled the
rich odors of the woods, the strange negro wandered
on toward Tickfall, his nose in the air.</p>

<p class='c005'>Incidentally he had some plans in the air.</p>
<h3 class='c010'>II<br /> <br />THREE MEN</h3>

<p class='c011'>Three men left the landing place of the airplane
and started for Tickfall, four miles away.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Rev. Vinegar Atts arrived first because he
was in a hurry, and ran every step. He staggered
into the Hen-Scratch saloon in the last stages of
physical exhaustion, and dropped down in a chair
beside a table.</p>

<p class='c005'>Three negroes sprang to their feet, terrified by
the colored clergyman’s appearance and manner.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Whut ails you, Vinegar?” Skeeter Butts exclaimed.
“You look like you done been run by
a ha’nt!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Wusser ’n dat, nigger,” Vinegar panted, as he
wiped the copious perspiration from his bald head,
and reached out a trembling hand for the reviving
drink which Figger Bush had thoughtfully brought
<a id='Page_293'></a>him. “I done seen a chariot of fire come straight
down from de glory of de Lawd!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Hitch Diamond glanced at the empty glass, and
then nodded significantly to Skeeter Butts.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Don’t gib him any more, Skeeter,” he suggested.
“De revun is done had too many drams
already.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“’Tain’t so,” Vinegar grunted. “I ain’t drunk.
I’m seein’—things!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I ketch on,” Hitch chuckled. “I done seen
things in my day, too. I seen a purple elerphunt
wunst. I wus settin’ on de side of a puffeckly
straight wall ticklin’ one of dese here ukuleles.
Whar you been at? Whut else did you see?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Been out in de swamp. Seen a chariot of fire
come down outen de sky. I heard it zoonin’ fer a
long time—sounded like a automobile. All de
birds in de woods flew up to see it, an’ squalled
like dey wus skeart to death. It lit out in de Little
Moccasin prairie.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Whut happened when she lit?” Figger Bush
inquired.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I didn’t stay to see,” Vinegar sighed. “Fer
a fack, I wus makin’ myse’f absent befo’ she lit.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Suddenly Skeeter Butts began to laugh. He
slapped his brown hand upon his thigh and cackled
like a hen. The more he laughed the funnier
something got to him.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I knows whut ails Vinegar, brudders,” he
snickered. “He’s done see a——”</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_294'></a>Skeeter’s assertion paused in midair, because
the door of the Hen-Scratch saloon was pushed
open, and the second man had arrived from
Moccasin prairie.</p>

<p class='c005'>This man was a stranger, and was built on circular
lines, round head, round eyes, round face,
round body. His character and modes of thought
and action also followed curved lines. There was
nothing straight about him.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Good evenin’, brudders,” he greeted them.
“My name am Red Cutt. Kin you-alls tell me
whut town dis is?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“How come you don’t know whar you is at?”
Skeeter asked suspiciously.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I jes’ landed,” Red Cutt remarked simply.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Didn’t de train corndoctor tell you whar you
wus gittin’ off?” Hitch Diamond rumbled. “Or
mebbe you rid de brake rods?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Naw, suh,” Red Cutt replied smilingly. “I
rode through de air.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Gimme somepin to hold on to, niggers,” Figger
Bush snickered, as he sat down with pretended
weakness in a chair and grasped the legs of the
table. “Here’s one nigger whut says he seen a
chariot of fire, and here comes a secont nigger whut
says he took a ride in it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“’Twarn’t no chariot of fire,” Cutt said easily.
“It was a airship. Didn’t none of you niggers
ever see no airplane?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Suttinly,” Skeeter Butts answered. “I done
<a id='Page_295'></a>seen a millyum of ’em in N’Awleens. But you is
de fust cullud aviator I’s seen.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dar ain’t many in de worl’,” Cutt said
quietly. “I reckin I’m about de fust nigger flier
in de worl’.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Listen to dat,” Vinegar Atts exploded. “Ef
I hadn’t been so skeart I’d ’a’ had good comp’ny
back to town.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Wus you de brudder dat wus bellerin’ so loud?”
Cutt inquired. “I heard somebody, but I couldn’t
locate ’em. I couldn’t find no good landin’ place
close to town. I wus skeart I’d tear up a lot of
fences an’ telegram poles ef I landed in Tickfall.
I wus skeart I’d hab to pay fer ’em. So I landed
out in de swamp.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dat wus right,” Figger Bush laughed. “No
Tickfall niggers, excusin’ Skeeter Butts, is got to
see a airship, an’ I b’lieves dat Skeeter is lyin’.
Ef you’d landed in town, all us Tickfalls would hab
fell in a well or run ourselfs to death.”</p>

<p class='c005'>At this moment the green-baize doors of the
saloon were pushed open and a white man entered.
The third man had arrived in Tickfall.</p>

<p class='c005'>At first glance he appeared to be a mechanic.
His hands were large, black with the grime of
machinery, and hard. His face and clothes were
streaked with grease. The skin of his face had
been whipped by the air until it was tanned like
leather.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Good evenin’ boss,” Skeeter exclaimed, standing
<a id='Page_296'></a>up and taking the stranger in at a glance. “Er—dis
here is a cullud bar, an’ us cain’t serve de
white——”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I don’t want a drink,” the young man answered.
“I want some information. Do any of
you know where Mr. Arsene Chieniere lives?”</p>

<p class='c005'>There was silence for a moment, then Vinegar
interpreted:</p>

<p class='c005'>“He means Mr. Arson Shinny!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“O—suttinly, suh,” Skeeter exclaimed. “He
lives right straight out dis road whut goes in front
of dis saloon. I seen Miss Jew-ann Shinny pass
here to-day—gwine todes home.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Miss Juan?” the young man asked, giving
the beautiful Latin pronunciation, and speaking
the word like a caress.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dat’s de lady,” Skeeter answered. “Dey lives
ten miles out on dis here road.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Where can I hire a flivver to take me out
there?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’s de only taxi-man in town,” Skeeter said,
as he reached for his cap. “I’ll take you out dar
in twenty minutes fer two dollars.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Get busy,” the young man answered, as he sat
down to wait.</p>

<p class='c005'>The other three negroes sat whispering to each
other for a few minutes, then Vinegar inquired:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Beg pardon, boss; ain’t you a railroad man?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes,” the stranger answered, with a barely
perceptible hesitation.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_297'></a>“I knowed it,” Vinegar chuckled. “I bet
Miss Jew-ann Shinny is gwine be glad to see you!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ll go to see now,” the young man smiled, as
he heard Skeeter’s machine at the door.</p>
<h3 class='c010'>III<br /> <br />“MISS JEW-ANN”</h3>

<p class='c011'>It was not possible for Skeeter Butts to keep his
mouth shut for twenty minutes, and the young
man beside him, as he watched the long sandy
road roll under the machine like a brown ribbon,
was equally willing to talk.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Is you-alls kin to de Shinnys?” Skeeter asked.</p>

<p class='c005'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Gwine dar on bizzness?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No—yes.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dar ain’t nobody at dat house to do bizzness
wid excusin’ Mr. Shinny an’ Miss Jew-ann.” No
answer. “Which one am you doin’ bizzness wid,
boss?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Which one do you think?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Of co’se, I’m jes’ guessin’—but ef I wus a white
man I’d shore crave to talk bizzness wid de lady.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That’s what I’m here for,” the stranger
laughed.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I done got you located now, boss,” Skeeter
chuckled delightedly. “You is courtin’.”</p>

<p class='c005'>They turned suddenly to the left and ran into
<a id='Page_298'></a>a dark road which lead through a section of the
Little Moccasin Swamp. The wheels began to
slip in the mire and Skeeter gave his entire attention
to his automobile to prevent stalling in the
mud. At last they reached firmer ground, and
Skeeter returned to the conversation.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Of co’se, I ain’t axin’ you fer no job, boss, but
I’s been powerful assistance to a whole passel of
young white mens dat’s come courtin’ in dis
country.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What special help can you render?” the
stranger asked.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Expe’unce an’ conversation,” Skeeter replied
promptly. “I done courted ’bout a millyum
womens my own self, an’ I knows all de funny
curves dey tries on. I gives exputt advice to all
de niggers dat marries in Tickfall. I ain’t no
marrifyin’ man myse’f, but I favors it an’ he’ps it
along.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“How can you render assistance through your
conversation?” the young man smiled.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Gosh, white man! You ain’t never done no
courtin’ in de South, is you? Eve’y white man
whut goes courtin’ hires a nigger to go wid him.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What for?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I see you don’t know nothin’,” Skeeter
chuckled. “I esplains dis fack; eve’y white lady
dat is wuth courtin’ is got some nigger gal wuckin’
fer her in de kitchen. Eve’y white man whut
onderstan’s courtin’ hires a nigger boy to go wid
<a id='Page_299'></a>him an’ wait on him while he courts de lady. Now,
dat nigger boy goes into de kitchen an’ tells dat
nigger gal whut a allfired good ketch fer de white
lady his boss am—an’ de nigger gal tells dat nigger
boy whut a histidious, highfalutin lady her mistiss
is, an’ dat arrangement he’ps courtin’ long an’ does
a large amount of great good.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The young man laughed, and Skeeter bent over
his wheel, watching the road for stumps as his
machine plowed through some high marsh-grass.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Now, I always gives my white man a good recommend
at de fust off-startin’,” Skeeter continued.
“I tells de nigger gal my white folks don’t drink
none, don’t gamble none, is got plenty money,
owns a big plantation, and hires plenty niggers.
When us mens goes home, dat nigger gal tells her
mistiss whut I said about her gen’leman friend.
Don’t you think dat’s a good arrangement?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I don’t know,” the young man said dubiously,
as they ran into a clearing and stopped in front of
a wide-spreading farmhouse. “I’ll wait and see.
I like to talk for myself, but I might need you
yet.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I hope so, boss,” Skeeter smiled as he pocketed
the two dollars which the young man extended.
“You want me to wait fer you?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Want me to come back fer you?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“A’right. Ef you needs me, jes’ ax fer Skeeter
<a id='Page_300'></a>Butts. I’s got a good name ’mongst de white and
de blacks.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Miss Juan Chieniere sat upon the wide, white
portico and watched, as the white man dismounted
from the machine. She watched until Skeeter had
turned and started back the way he had come.
She watched the young man turn and enter the
gate. All of this with indifference, which suddenly
turned to an interest, which left her gasping with
delight.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh—Jim!”</p>

<p class='c005'>The Frenchwoman makes the most fascinating
sweetheart and the most attractive wife in the
world, to all except a blind man. To all the other
things which the Frenchwoman possesses in common
with her sisters, she adds the charm of manner.
In other words, when she loves a man, she
shows it! The glance of the eye, the quiver of the
lips, the gesture of her hands, these things speak
for her and plead for her and pray for her!</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh—Jim!” she repeated.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I told you I was coming,” was all that Jim
said.</p>

<p class='c005'>“But—how did you get here, Jim?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I flew through the air like a bird, just like I
told you I would.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Her hand motioned him to a seat by her side,
and every posture of her body, as she moved
aside to give him space, bespoke a welcome without
words.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_301'></a>“Where did you get the airplane, Jim?” she
questioned.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I stole it,” Jim answered frankly. “I stole
it from the government of the United States. It’s
an army airplane, designed to strafe the Huns. I
just hopped in, shot the juice to her, and flew
seventy miles to see you!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Holy Mother!” the girl exclaimed tragically.
“What will they do to you for that crime?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I should worry—they haven’t caught me yet.
Besides, I’ve got a whale of a lie fixed up to tell
them.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Let me hear your lie, Jimmy,” the girl fluttered.
“I’ll be scared to death while you are here,
unless the lie is a real good one, and will save you
if you get caught.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Jim hesitated a moment while he reached for
his cigarette-case. The girl took the match from
his fingers, struck it into flame, and held it to his
cigarette, thus lighting his face and her own in
the gathering dusk.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Whew,” he whistled, as his hungry eyes devoured
the beauty of her face. “It would have
been worth it if I had stolen a whole squadron of
war-ships to come to see you in.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Tell me the beautiful alibi lie, Jimmy,” the
girl insisted.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You can’t appreciate the value of a lie until
you know the truth,” Jimmy began, inhaling his
cigarette smoke. “The truth is this: I have been
<a id='Page_302'></a>in the aviation camp for eighteen months without
a chance of getting leave of absence to come to see
you. The only chance I have ever had to talk
has been on your visits to your brother at the
camp, and those opportunities have been too few.
Now, I am an expert airplane mechanic, and in repairing
machines I am permitted to try them out
before brave aviators like your brother are permitted
to risk their valuable lives in them. So
this afternoon I repaired a machine and took a
trial flight which has extended for seventy miles,
and which ended just about four miles from Tickfall,
and ten miles by automobile from you. I
came here to see you because I love you, and
before I go back I expect your promise to marry
me!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, how perfectly glorious!” the girl exclaimed.
“That’s the truth! Now, tell me the
beautiful lie!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“When I go back to the camp I shall tell them
that I started out on a trial flight, and had engine
trouble; had to land in the heart of these great
Louisiana swamps, and lost my bearings. I shall
tell them I spent two days wandering in the wilderness
like the children of Israel before I found a
human habitation. There I got help, made my
repairs, and hurried back!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That’s fine, Jimmy!” Juan exclaimed. “But
will they believe it?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I don’t know. If you think it is too risky,
<a id='Page_303'></a>suppose you promise to marry me right now, and
let me hurry back?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You’re joking, now, Jimmy,” the girl answered
promptly. “You must save your lies and
jokes till you get back to camp. Maybe they’ll
believe them.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The door opened, and a handsome gentleman
stepped out upon the porch.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Father,” the girl said, as they both rose to their
feet, “this is Mr. James Gannaway, from the aviation
camp where brother is.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I welcome you, young man,” Mr. Chieniere
exclaimed cordially. “I wish you were my son
come in from the camp.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I wish so, too,” Jim said simply, and his words
held a meaning which the father did not get.</p>
<h3 class='c010'>IV<br /> <br />THE FLYING CLUB</h3>

<p class='c011'>When Skeeter Butts returned to the Hen-Scratch
saloon, he found his three friends at the
table, listening with the most intense interest to
the speech of the stranger recently arrived among
them, Red Cutt.</p>

<p class='c005'>They were so intent upon his words that Skeeter
regretted his absence from the saloon. He felt
that he had missed something of the utmost importance,
for he had never seen his three friends
<a id='Page_304'></a>more excited than they were at that particular
moment. Skeeter paused at the door and listened.
Red Cutt was speaking.</p>

<p class='c005'>“De fust time I ever saw anybody go up in de
air wus at a county fair. Dar wus a balloon tied
on de end of a rope, an’ a white man wus in charge,
and he let eve’ybody whut had a dollar go up in de
air as fur as de rope went.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“How many foots could you go up?” Vinegar
inquired.</p>

<p class='c005'>“One thousand foots,” Red Cutt informed him.
“Dat is as fur as de rope stretched. Of co’se if
de rope broke, I imagines a nigger might hab went
a heap farther, but dey wouldn’t charged him
nothin’ fer dat extry trip.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“An’ did you go up in it?” Hitch Diamond asked.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Naw, I didn’t hab no dollar; but I made up my
mind right dar dat some day I wus gwine up.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Skeeter Butts joined the company at this point,
sat down and lighted a cigarette, leaned back and
asked with great nonchalance:</p>

<p class='c005'>“How long has you been tryin’ to fly, Brudder
Red Cutt?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I been at it for the last ’leven or twelve months.
Is you had any expe’unce flyin’?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Naw, suh, I ain’t had much to speak about,”
Skeeter Butts replied. “Of co’se, I took a few
little flies when I wus in de army, but I didn’t run
de machine myself, an’ I don’t know very much
about it.”</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_305'></a>“I’m glad to hear you say dat, Skeeter,” Red
Cutt responded. “You see, my bizzness jes’ now
is travelin’ through de country teachin’ cullud
folks how to fly dese machines. De gover’ment
of the Nunited States is makin’ about a million of
dese airships eve’y week. As soon as de war is over
dey won’t have no need for dem airships in de
Europe war, an’ dey will have about forty millions
dat dey will want to sell cheap.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dat sounds good to me,” Skeeter Butts said
in pleased anticipation. “I always has wanted
one of dem things.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, you kin git you one,” Red Cutt said. “A
good hand-me-down airship—dis here gover’ment
will be mighty nigh givin’ ’em away, because dey
won’t have no whar to keep ’em atter de war is
over.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ll shore git me one,” Hitch Diamond said in
a loud voice.</p>

<p class='c005'>Red Cutt looked at him and nodded his head
approvingly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ll git me one,” Vinegar Atts proclaimed.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Put me down for one, de best one you got,”
Skeeter Butts announced.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I ain’t sellin’ ’em, nigger,” Red Cutt laughed.
“I learns fellers how to fly in ’em. The gover’ment
ain’t gwine deliver ’em to you. Dey will all
be landed at de same place on de Gulf of Mexico,
an’ eve’y nigger has got to go git his own an’ pick
out of the bunch de one dat he wants.”</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_306'></a>“You means dat we got to fly our own machine
home?” Skeeter Butts inquired.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Suttingly,” Red Cutt answered.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Gosh! I reckon we does need lessons in
flyin’,” Vinegar Atts proclaimed.</p>

<p class='c005'>“One dollar, per lesson, each nigger,” Red Cutt
announced in a businesslike tone.</p>

<p class='c005'>“How many niggers is allowed to learn at one
time?” Skeeter inquired.</p>

<p class='c005'>“One hundred niggers. We organizes de High
Exalted Nigger Flyin’ Club, and we all takes lessons
at the same time.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“When is we gwine organize dis club?” Skeeter
Butts inquired.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It will suit me best if we organizes to-night,”
Red Cutt replied. “Because, you see, I ain’t got
so awful long to stay at any one place.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I kin fix dat,” Hitch Diamond growled. “De
Nights of Darkness lodge meets to-night. We
has got a little mo’ dan one hundred members, but
dar never wus a lodge full of niggers whar all of ’em
had one dollar per each at one time. So I imagines
dat when we sends out word dat eve’y nigger dat
comes to de lodge to-night must have a dollar fer
a special puppus dar won’t be mo’ dan one hunderd
dat will see deir way clear to come.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“We might take our fust lesson at de lodge to-night,
atter we completes de organization,” Red
Cutt suggested.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dat will suit me perzackly,” Hitch rumbled.
<a id='Page_307'></a>“I’s de presidunt of de Nights of Darkness lodge,
and I’ll give de word, an’ whut I says goes.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Red Cutt reached to his hip-pocket and brought
forth a red-covered book and laid it on the table
before them. Vinegar Atts leaned over and gazed
at the title of the book—“How to Fly.” He
opened to the title-page of the volume and beheld
a picture of a man dressed in the aviator
costume, with his goggles pushed back on his forehead,
his mouth wide-spread in a happy grin.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Somepin shore tickles dis flyin’-man,” he
chuckled. “I wonder is he so awful pleased wid
himself because he is gwine up or because he has
jes’ come down?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“As fer as I am concerned,” Skeeter cackled,
“I think I could pull a bigger grin atter I done
come down dan I could ef I wus jes’ gwine up.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Atter you has studied dis book a while, an’
tuck a few lessons in runnin’ de machine, you will
laugh de most at de chance of gwine up,” Red told
him.</p>

<p class='c005'>He handed the book to Vinegar opened at the
preface, and said:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Read whut it says at the fust openin’ of de
book.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The colored clergyman leaned back and gazed
at the page, reading aloud, giving to the words his
peculiar African pronunciation.</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘Wid a desire to train an aviator into proper
capability so dat he may, when embarkin’ on his
<a id='Page_308'></a>career, have skillful an’ complete knowledge of his
perfession——’”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dat’s de word!” Red proclaimed. “Skillful
an’ complete knowledge of his perfession!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘An’ fly widout dose disasterous an’ unnervin’
consequences—’” Vinegar resumed but was instantly
interrupted.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dat’s de sentence whut suits me best,” Skeeter
announced. “I don’t want no disasterous an’
unnervin’ consequences when I gits up in de air.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dis here am de very book dat shows you how
not to have ’em,” Red Cutt said. “An’ dis is de
rule dat we go by.”</p>

<p class='c005'>He rapidly turned over the pages of the preface,
indicating a place on the page, and allowed Vinegar
to resume his reading.</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘Do not rush students through deir trainin’.
Haste makes waste. Dis fack should be inscribed
on de door of every hangar.’”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Hanger!” Figger Bush exclaimed. “How
come dat book speaks about hangin’? I thought
we wus talkin’ about flyin’, an’ now you done got
off de subjeck.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The other three negroes looked at Red Cutt
rebukingly, as if they also thought that he had
brought into the matter of flying a theme which no
negro in the South cares to discuss. He is willing
to walk, to run, to swim or fly, but he has an insuperable
aversion to hanging.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dat shows dat you niggers have got a heap to
<a id='Page_309'></a>learn,” Red Cutt laughed. “A hangar is jes’ like a
stable. You keeps a buggy in de stable, an’ a automobile
in de garage, an’ a airplane in a hangar.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Mebbe so,” Skeeter said in a dissatisfied tone.
“But I don’t like dat word, jes’ de same.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dar ain’t no noose to dis hangar I speaks of,”
Red Cutt assured him.</p>

<p class='c005'>“No noose is good noose,” Skeeter proclaimed.
“But I don’t like dat word.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Don’t let a word pester you,” Red Cutt
laughed as he rose to his feet and picked up his
hat. “Meet me at de Nights of Darkness lodge
to-night an’ I’ll tell you some things dat will git
on your squeamishness heap wuss dan a word.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“We will all be dar!” the quartet chorused.</p>

<p class='c005'>“All you got to do is to be dar wid yo’ dollar,”
Red Cutt answered as he stepped through the
green-baize door of the saloon.</p>
<h3 class='c010'>V<br /> <br />A NEW THING</h3>

<p class='c011'>The ancient Greek of apostolic days was not
alone in his eagerness “to see and to hear some new
thing.” When the word went abroad in the negro
settlements of Tickfall that there was to be a new
thing at the lodge that night, cost of admission
being one dollar, three hundred and twenty-five
negroes, by methods distinctly Ethiopian, secured
<a id='Page_310'></a>the necessary dollar, which for that night only
was the password to the lodge.</p>

<p class='c005'>When Red Cutt appeared upon the scene, he by
himself was worth the price of admission. He
had dressed himself in a faint imitation of the
costume of an aviator. That costume was a mixture
of all the varied uniforms that he had seen,
and portions of which he could acquire.</p>

<p class='c005'>Beginning at the feet, for some reason known
only to himself, he wore a pair of spurs; around
his legs were leather puttees—to that extent he
resembled a cavalry officer. His pantaloons were
hunting-breeches. His coat was a hunting-coat,
somewhat appropriate because it was rain-proof,
and might shed oil easily. His head-covering was
a cap with a rubber visor, and his eyes were
covered with enormous automobile goggles. He
wore gauntlets on his hands, and somewhere he
had acquired four brass buttons, from each of
which was suspended a gaudy ribbon. He had
evidently acquired these decorative ribbons at
some association of drummers or the convention
of some political party. One ribbon bore the
words “Reception Committee.” A second ribbon
was inscribed “Delegate,” and a third ribbon bore
the magic word “Information.”</p>

<p class='c005'>He was escorted to a seat on the rostrum by the
president of the lodge, and looking through his
automobile goggles at the crowd of negroes assembled,
he was surprised, and felt some uneasiness.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_311'></a>He had expected not more than one hundred
negroes. That would have been a crowd that
he could manage; but when he found exactly
three times that number, the assemblage looked
to him too much like a mob—or at least it looked
like it might be easily converted into one.</p>

<p class='c005'>Hitch Diamond rose to his feet.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Brudders, dar is a cullud pusson here to-night
who is come on a important job. He is de only
nigger in dis country whut ever went up in a airship.
He has had plenty expe’unce as a flyin’
man, an’ he has come to learn us all how to fly up!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Whar we gwine fly to?” a voice spoke up.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Wharever you wants to go,” Hitch Diamond
answered.</p>

<p class='c005'>At this point Pap Curtain rose to his feet. “Is
dis here nigger a member of our lodge, Mr. Pres’dunt?”
he snarled.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Naw, suh.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Is dis here some new degree we takes in dis
lodge?” Pap persisted.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Naw, suh.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, whut is dis about?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ef you’ll set down, Pap,” Hitch growled, “an’
let our visitin’ brudder tell his bizzness in his own
way, mebbe you’ll git some information.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’s one of de bo’d of directors of dis here lodge,”
Pap snarled. “Ef dar is any bizzness dat I ain’t
seen about befo’hand, I’m ag’in’ it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The lodge members showed impatience at this
<a id='Page_312'></a>interruption. Pap had been a conscientious objector
to nearly everything the lodge had ever
undertaken. He was quick to notice their impatience,
and sat down grumbling to himself.</p>

<p class='c005'>Red Cutt arose and fingered the three badges on
his breast. Touching one particular badge by the
corner, and holding it out so that the lodge could
see, he announced:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dis badge is marked ‘Information,’ an’ means
dat I’m de man who answers questions an’ kin tell
Pap Curtain whut he wants to know. Most of you
knows my visit to dis town is to organize a school
of flyin’ niggers. Some of you knows how to run
automobiles, an’ so you kin ride over de country.
I wants to learn you how to fly through de sky jes’
as easy as you walk on de ground. Atter you have
got de lesson in yo’ mind, I will he’p you to buy a
cheap airship from de gover’ment, an’ den you
will be fixed jes’ like Gawd intended fer a nigger
to be.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Pap Curtain sprang to his feet, waved his hat
in the air, and exclaimed in a loud voice:</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ve heard tell of dese flyin’ fellers, but I ain’t
never seen one fly. Ef dis visitin’ brudder has
come to give an exhibition I favors it!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dat’s whut he has come to do,” Hitch assured
him.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Whar is yo’ flyin’-machine at?” Pap howled.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Out in de Little Moccasin prairie,” Red told
him.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_313'></a>“Less go out an’ take a look at it!” Pap
exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I favor it,” three hundred negroes shouted in
a chorus.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I nominates myself to lead de peerade!”
Vinegar Atts vociferated.</p>

<p class='c005'>The movement was so unanimous that Red
Cutt was frightened. He had no desire to go out
to that airplane in the dark. He remembered a
negro who had come to a little town where he had
lived once and had pretended to be able to walk
on the water. He posed as a divine healer, and a
frequently made statement was: “I kin walk on
de water, but I don’t want to.” Thereupon some
skeptical negroes had carried him down to the
banks of the Mississippi and tossed him headlong
into the yellow stream, insisting that he give them
a demonstration of his ability to do what he said
he could do. They had fished this divine healer
out of the river with a hook and rolled him on a
barrel for an hour before he showed the least sign
of returning consciousness. Red Cutt was appalled
by the thought of what might happen to
him if that mob of negroes insisted upon his giving
a trial flight.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Come on, niggers!” Vinegar Atts bellowed.
“Less go out an’ see de flyin’-machine!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Three hundred negroes moved their feet as one
man. Hitch Diamond laid his hand upon the arm
of Red Cutt about as a policeman would put a man
<a id='Page_314'></a>under arrest. Vinegar stepped forward and got
on the other side of the aviator, and they conducted
him down the rickety stairs of the lodge
room and led the procession that formed in a straggling
line in the middle of the sandy street.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was a night in which the moon shone in all
its glory—such a moon as glows over the Louisiana
swamps when the humidity of the atmosphere
seems to focus the rays in startling brightness on
every object. The negro is like a cat, sleepy and
dull during the day; but he wakes up at night,
and is a prowler in the streets and woods and fields.
It was four miles to the Little Moccasin prairie,
but that tramping crowd of men thought nothing
of that, and as they marched they sang, keeping
step to music that carried echoes of the African
jungle, and those minor tones which are characteristic
of all people who have been enslaved since
the ancient days when subjugated Israel in the
land of Egypt “hung their harps on the willows.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Look here, niggers,” Red said to Vinegar and
Hitch. “Dis is not de proper night to take a ride
in a airplane. De moon is shining too dang bright.
Ef I git up fawty thousand foots in de air, an’ look
down at the yearth in dis moonlight, eve’ything
below me would look like a smooth sheet of white
paper. I never would know whar I come from,
an’ I wouldn’t know whar to land, an’ I might
drif’ off, whar nobody never could find me, an’
whar I cain’t never git back here.”</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_315'></a>“We don’t want nothin’ like dat,” Hitch Diamond
growled. “We cain’t affode to lose you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ef dese niggers insist on me takin’ a ride, how
is we gwine prevent it?” Red Cutt inquired.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ll tell you,” Vinegar replied. “When we
gits out whar de airship is at, I’ll make ’em a
speech.”</p>

<p class='c005'>In an hour they reached that point in the Little
Moccasin prairie where the airplane rested on the
smooth short grass. When they approached that
wonder-mechanism of man’s hand and brain, the
negroes became reverently silent, and yet that
silence was vocal with the weird, nerve-racking
funereal sounds of the swamp. Great bullfrogs
bellowed like multitudinous lost cattle; a wildcat
screamed like the tones of a woman in great pain
and fright; and the swamp wolves galloped to the
edge of the clearing and barked at them with all
the annoying impertinence of fice dogs.</p>

<p class='c005'>Vinegar Atts did not like the looks of the airship.
It was the first he had ever seen, and it bore
too much resemblance to a wasp, and looked very
much as if it might carry a dangerous stinger in its
tail. With the true orator’s instinct for dramatic
effect, he looked around to find the most impressive
place for him to stand. Not at the tail, because
that might be dangerous; not at the sides,
for wasp might flap its wings; so he moved up in
front and stood looking with great interest at a
wheel of paddles right in front of the machine.
<a id='Page_316'></a>That did not look good to him, either, so he backed
off well out of range, and announced:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Brudders of the Nights of Darkness lodge, as
fer as I knows, dar ain’t only two niggers in dis
crowd dat ever seen one of dese things befo’, but
dis here chariot of fire ain’t no new thing. De
Prophet Elijah went up in one of ’em to heaven.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Bless Gawd!” a negro’s voice exclaimed
reverently.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then in his rich barytone voice, Vinegar Atts
began to sing, and one by one the voices of the
negroes joined in:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I rode on de sky,</div>
      <div class='line'>Went up mighty high,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Nor did envy Elijah his seat;</div>
      <div class='line'>My soul mounted higher</div>
      <div class='line'>In a chariot of fire,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And the moon, it wus under my feet.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>In the melody of this song all the weird, jungle
voices of the swamp were silenced. It seemed as
if every bird and beast stood still to listen, and
the Gulf breeze, playing over the fluted tree-tops,
made a beautiful, Eolian accompaniment to the
rich African voices.</p>

<p class='c005'>Startled eyes glanced up at that moon which
rode majestically through the still oceans of the sky,
and the soul of every man was filled with awe at
the thought of having that globe of glowing yellow
under his brogan-shod feet. It was a thought to
<a id='Page_317'></a>stir the Ethiopian soul to its depths, laying hold
upon the rich Oriental imagination, appealing to
the jungle heritage of superstition, and causing them
to thrill with mingled feelings of rapture and fear.</p>

<p class='c005'>Vinegar Atts knew the value of the oratorical
pause; he waited until the sighing of the trees
and the radiance of the moonbeams had touched
even the most stupid mind among them. And
then in a deep, solemn voice he continued:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Way back in de Ole Testarment day whar
people lived forty thousan’ years ago, de Prophet
Ezekiel tell us about dis here machine. I wus
readin’ it to-night, and dis is whut de Good Book
says:</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘I looked an’ behold in de firmament dat wus
above my head, dar wus de appearance of de likeness
of a throne——’”</p>

<p class='c005'>“My Gawd!” an awed voice exclaimed, as all
the negroes turned and looked at the seat in the
airplane. Vinegar Atts resumed:</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘Dar appeared in de cherubim de form of a
man’s hand under de wings, an’ when I looked,
behold, four wheels as ef a wheel had been in de
midst of a wheel. An’ when de cherubim went, de
wheels went wid him——’”</p>

<p class='c005'>“My—good—gosh!” Pap Curtain interrupted
with his snarling voice, his tone surcharged with
terror.</p>

<p class='c005'>Vinegar Atts paid no heed to the interruption,
but went on in a voice that was like a great bellow:</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_318'></a>“‘De cherubim lifted up deir wings to mount
from de yearth, an’ de same wheels turned not from
beside dem; when dey stood, dese stood, an’ when
dey wus lifted up, dese lifted up demselves also,
fer de spirit of de livin’ creature wus in dem, an’ de
cherubim lifted up deir wings an’ mounted from de
yearth in my sight.’”</p>

<p class='c005'>With the utterance of the last word, Vinegar
waved his hand in a dramatic gesture toward the
sky. There was one dark cloud in all the clearness
of the atmosphere, a mass of fog and mist which
had risen from the Gulf of Mexico and was scudding
with amazing speed before the stiff, salty
breeze from the south. The negroes glanced up
at that cloud and watched it as it became smaller,
sped to the edge of the horizon made by the forest,
and disappeared from their sight. It seemed to
them that some winged creature of the sky had
sailed above them, and Vinegar, in his great superb
barytone voice, began to sing:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Let de chariot of fire roll by,</div>
      <div class='line'>De sooner earth’s trials and sorrers shall cease,</div>
      <div class='line'>De sooner us’ll enter de mansions of peace—</div>
      <div class='line'>Let de chariot of fire roll by!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The famous Tickfall quartet was there. Instantly
Hitch Diamond, Skeeter Butts, and Figger
Bush chimed in, and the song swept out across the
silence of the swamp, echoing in that vast greenhouse
<a id='Page_319'></a>of vegetation which grew in such rank profusion.
From the throats of three hundred negroes
issued a low, moaning wail in perfect harmony
with the music.</p>

<p class='c005'>Vinegar Atts and Hitch Diamond turned and
walked away. Skeeter Butts and Figger Bush
followed, still singing, and the other negroes forgot
the purpose for which they had walked four miles
into the woods, and meekly, without protestation,
trailed their leaders back to the town.</p>

<p class='c005'>After all, they had seen enough to pay them for
their trip. They had seen an airplane for the first
time. They had something to think about; something
to talk about, and, as for the flight of Red
Cutt, they had something to anticipate.</p>

<p class='c005'>One man alone was dissatisfied, but he was always
dissatisfied. The sneer on Pap Curtain’s
lips was more pronounced, and the snarl in his
voice was accentuated as he said to those who
plodded along in the rear of the procession:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dat Red Cutt wus pretty sharp when he side-tracked
his ride in dat airplane fer a speech by
Elder Vinegar Atts. But dat nigger can’t excape
away, an’ I’ll make him fly yit or know the reason
why.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The other negroes did not answer. They were
too busy harmonizing with the Tickfall quartet:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Swing low, sweet chariot,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Coming to carry me home.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div>
  <a id='Page_320'></a>
  <h3 class='c010'>VI<br /> <br />A FEATHER IN HIS HAT</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Early the next morning there were four men
who paid a visit to all the negro settlements in
Tickfall. They explained that they were a canvassing
committee who were soliciting members
for the High Exalted Negro Flying Club.</p>

<p class='c005'>Red Cutt had told them that it was impossible to
teach three hundred negroes at one time the art of
aviation. The classes could not consist of more
than one hundred, but he was willing to teach
as many as wanted to learn. He said that he would
have to divide them into three classes, and instruct
just one class at a time.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was the Tickfall Big Four who did the canvassing,
and after a while there was a disagreement
among them. The religious adherents of Vinegar’s
church fell out like the early disciples over the
question of “Who should be greatest?”</p>

<p class='c005'>They went back to Red Cutt and presented the
matter to him.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Who’s gwine be president of dis here club?”
Skeeter Butts demanded.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I thinks you ought to be presidunt,” Red told
him, “because you done had some expe’unce as a
flyin’ man.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ain’t dar no mo’ jobs connected wid dis club?”
Vinegar Atts inquired.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_321'></a>“Suttinly,” Red told him. “I app’ints you
observer right now.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What do a observer do?” Vinegar Atts inquired.</p>

<p class='c005'>“He sets up in de airplane an’ looks at de scenery
an’ lets de worl’ go by.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dat suits me,” Vinegar bellowed. “Settin’
down an’ lookin’ at things is a easy, high, hon’able
job.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I needs a job, too,” Hitch Diamond grumbled.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I app’ints you mechanic,” Red Cutt announced
promptly. “Git yo’ tools an’ all yo’
wipin’ rags an’ git ready fer de job of keepin’ dat
machine in order.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Whut do I git to do?” Figger Bush wanted to
know.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I nomernates you stabilizer.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Does dat mean dat I keeps de stable whar de
machine stays at?” Figger Bush inquired.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yep, you is de high boss keeper of the hangar,
an’ yo’ job is to steady the machine when folks
climbs in an’ climbs out.”</p>

<p class='c005'>That each negro was satisfied with his job was
apparent from the fact that he took out a cigarette
and lighted it, and sat for a while in silent meditation.
At last Vinegar spoke.</p>

<p class='c005'>“We done collected up over a hundred dollars
already.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The eyes of Red Cutt glowed like the little green
eyes of a pig. He wet his lips with his tongue as
<a id='Page_322'></a>if he could already taste that money. His fingers
twitched and he clasped them together covetously,
saying, in a voice that was hungry with desire:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Gimme dat money, quick, niggers. I always
demands my pay in eggsvance.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The four negroes promptly emptied their pockets
of the money they had collected, and Red Cutt
drew a large buckskin bag from his coat pocket and
eagerly stuffed the soiled currency into its depths.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I thinks eve’y nigger dat pays his dollar out
ought to be allowed to wear some kind of badge what
shows dat be belongs,” Vinegar Atts remarked.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I forgot to tell you about dat, nigger,” Red
Cutt replied promptly. “So I wants you to pass
de word down de line to eve’y nigger dat paid his
dollar dat he must get a chicken feather and wear
it stuck up in his hat.”</p>

<p class='c005'>By two o’clock that afternoon, one hundred
negroes in Tickfall suddenly sprouted feathers, and
refused to tell in answer to any inquiry just what
those feathers meant, for if a negro organizes a
club or lodge, it is always a secret organization.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was Sunday afternoon.</p>

<p class='c005'>That morning, Vinegar, at the Shoofly church,
made many eloquent references to the chariot of
fire, to the men from the sky, to the machine that
had a wheel in the midst of a wheel, and a form of a
man’s hand under the wings. It was just the sort
of mysterious, high-sounding, and meaningless sermon
that would catch the fancy of his emotional
<a id='Page_323'></a>and imaginative parishioners and the services at
the Shoofly church on that particular morning
were memorable.</p>

<p class='c005'>At the most dramatic point of Vinegar’s harangue,
the colored clergyman took a letter out
of his pocket and read it to his congregation with
many theatrical flourishes.</p>

<p class='c005'>There are big corporations in this country who
do a large mail-order business. Of necessity, they
must have a large mailing-list, and in order to acquire
it they pay two cents for every name and
address that is furnished them. Very much of
that money is wasted in the South, and a great deal
of their literature is squandered, for the reason
that those who sell these addresses do not care
whether it is the name of a man white or black.</p>

<p class='c005'>Many negroes who cannot read get regular letters
from great mail-order houses, and other large
corporations who have something to sell will frequently
address a letter to a colored man who
cannot read it, and cannot understand it when it
is read to him.</p>

<p class='c005'>By this method Vinegar Atts had acquired the
letter, which he was now parading before his congregation,
and which he read in a loud, clear voice:</p>

<p class='c013'>“<span class='sc'>Rev. Vinegar Atts</span>,</p>
<p class='c014'>“Tickfall, Louisiana.</p>

<p class='c015'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Sir</span>: Draw up your chair just a little closer;
listen carefully and we will suggest to you how to make
some money by investing a small amount.
<a id='Page_324'></a>“We are going to tell you about that opportunity
you have been waiting for all your life. We are going
to let you in on one of the best propositions offered
since manufacturers tried to interest people financially
in the automobile years ago.</p>

<p class='c015'>“The war is over—peace is here—the airplane
helped win that victory, and now the airplane will
rapidly take the place of the automobile and the truck
in commercial life.</p>

<p class='c015'>“The man who makes money is the man who has
the courage to back up his convictions. While money
can be earned by labor, it can be multiplied only by
investment. We offer you an opportunity to get in
on the ground floor of this money-making proposition
and reap the tremendous profits which we believe are
bound to follow.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Please read the enclosed folder carefully, and then
if you decide you want to invest a modest sum and
see it grow, let us hear from you at once.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Laying this letter aside, Vinegar spread open a
folder to the gaze of his congregation. It contained
impressive pictures of airplanes, and hydroplanes,
of factories, and of work upon the big machines in
their various stages of development.</p>

<p class='c005'>“One dollar is a mighty modest sum, brudder,”
Vinegar bellowed. “Eve’y man whut is got a
dollar ought to git in on de ground floor of dis
money-makin’ proposition an’ reap de tremendous
profits which is bound to follow behind. Dar is a
flyin’-school teacher in dis town now, and I considers
<a id='Page_325'></a>it a religious thing to endorse his bizzness
an’ to git up a lot of learners in his flyin’-school.”</p>

<p class='c005'>It was whispered among the folks at the church
that the first lesson in the art of flying would be
given in the Little Moccasin prairie where the
airplane was. So very early in the afternoon a
long procession of negroes moved in that direction,
and a very curious crowd had assembled about the
machine. When the aviator, Red Cutt, made his
appearance, he stood by the machine and delivered
a harangue, explaining various parts of the machine,
and calling them by certain names which
would have been very interesting if heard in the
aviation schools of this country.</p>

<p class='c005'>Being familiar with the automobile, he could
make a pretty shrewd guess at some things; but
he also had that inestimable advantage which
comes to the man who pretends to know when all
others profess their ignorance.</p>

<p class='c005'>A few minutes later, Hitch arrived. He carried
an immense sack full of all sorts of tools. There
was even an instrument for digging in the ground
in that assortment, for Hitch was evidently ready,
as the chief mechanic, to meet all emergencies.
He carried also a large bag of cotton, with which
he intended to wipe off the machinery and keep
everything shining and bright just like new.</p>

<p class='c005'>Skeeter arrived, looked at the machine, and
listened to Red Cutt explaining its uses and manipulations
to the crowd. He saw Hitch crawling
<a id='Page_326'></a>around underneath, wiping the wheels with cotton,
and pretending to be very busy, while actually
afraid to touch anything he saw under there.</p>

<p class='c005'>Skeeter decided that his place on the program
was to be seated in the machine. The negroes
very eagerly lifted him up, and as he took his place
on the seat, he felt that he had reached the highest
point of prominence in his entire career.</p>

<p class='c005'>Vinegar Atts, who had lingered too long at his
Sunday dinner, was the last to arrive, and when he
rode up in his little automobile and saw Skeeter
Butts seated in the airplane like a king upon the
throne, he was glad, indeed, that he had been
elected to the high office of observer.</p>

<p class='c005'>He pushed his way through the crowd and
bawled at Skeeter:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Hey, Skeeter! I wants to set up dar wid
you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dar ain’t no room to set wid me,” Skeeter
announced. “Dar ain’t but one seat, an’ I am
in it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But I got to set up dar! I’m de observer!”
Vinegar howled.</p>

<p class='c005'>Thereupon he clambered up into the machine,
lifted Skeeter out of his place, sat down on the
seat himself, and let Skeeter sit on his knee!</p>

<p class='c005'>At this point Hitch Diamond climbed out from
under the airplane, stuck a handful of dirty cotton
waste into the bag that contained the rest of the
cotton, and tossed the bag into the lap of Skeeter.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_327'></a>“You two niggers put dis sack of cotton in the
tool-box under de seat!” Hitch Diamond bellowed.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I cain’t find de tool-box,” Vinegar said.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, put it under yo’ foots den,” Hitch told
him. “Fer you got to take dat sack of wipin’
cotton wharever you go.”</p>
<h3 class='c010'>VII<br /> <br />THE SIGN OF AVIATORS</h3>

<p class='c011'>As the negroes had gone out toward the Little
Moccasin Swamp, all of them had passed a buggy
that was moving at the slowest gait of the horse.
The driving lines were wrapped around the whip,
the horse moved sedately and slowly down the
middle of the road. On the seat of the buggy was
a young man who seemed to be able to see nothing
but the girl who sat beside him; and if any other
man had been blind to the presence of that girl, it
could have been said of him that he had no appreciation
of feminine beauty and loveliness. As
the buggy passed the long, straggling procession
of negroes, there was one fact so striking that the
man asked:</p>

<p class='c005'>“What are all these people wearing chicken
feathers in their hats for?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I don’t know,” the girl answered. “Nobody
can tell what a negro is going to do.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The negroes turned off into a little bridle path,
<a id='Page_328'></a>leaving the road free for the horse and buggy, and
the young folks promptly forgot them. But when
they drove at the same leisurely gait into Tickfall,
they passed the Hen-Scratch saloon. There they
beheld a diminutive darky, dressed in ragged
clothes, seated in a disconsolate attitude on the
curbstone in front of that popular barroom. His
name was Little Bit, and both noticed that he wore
a chicken feather in his hat.</p>

<p class='c005'>For some reason the horse stopped in front of
the barroom. Possibly the animal had been there
before. The young man and woman did not object,
for they had no destination in mind, and it
really did not matter where they went or where
they were.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Look here, colored boy!” Jim spoke. “What
are you and all the other negroes wearing that
feather in your hat for?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dat sign is fer aviators, boss,” Little Bit
answered.</p>

<p class='c005'>Miss Juan Chieniere turned and shot a significant
glance at the young man sitting beside her.</p>

<p class='c005'>That young man’s face turned as white as milk.
The lines of gentleness and good nature around
his mouth changed until the whole face was drawn
in lineaments of desperate recklessness. The one
thought in his mind, of course, was that a scouting
party had been sent out to look for the lost airplane,
and the aviators had come to Tickfall. He
had no idea what punishment would await him at
<a id='Page_329'></a>the aviation camp if he was captured in Tickfall
and taken back.</p>

<p class='c005'>Something of his great danger was conceived by
the girl, and she asked in a nervous voice:</p>

<p class='c005'>“What aviators, Little Bit?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I dunno, Miss Jew-ann,” Little Bit answered.
“But all de niggers has gone out to the Little
Moccasin prairie to see the airships. Dey wouldn’t
let me go. Dey made me stay at home and take
keer of de saloon.”</p>

<p class='c005'>This remark confirmed Jim Gannaway’s fears
that the scouting party had really arrived in Tickfall.
He had scanned the horizon many times
since his arrival in that neighborhood on the evening
before, and he wondered how that scouting
party had arrived without his seeing them. His
soul was tormented with anxiety, and he turned
and looked at the girl as if he was seeing her for
the last time. Dismounting from the buggy, he
stood close beside her and said:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Juan, I took a desperate risk in coming from
the aviation camp to see you. I could not borrow
a machine for the purpose, and could not have got
leave of absence, so I had to swipe a machine. I
told you I had come to get your promise to marry
me, but I cannot ask you now because I have no
idea what they will do to me when they take me
back to camp.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What about that beautiful lie, Jim?” she
asked with trembling lips.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_330'></a>“It would have been all right if I had made my
way back to the camp without being caught; but
now they have come after me, and there is nothing
for me to tell but the beautiful truth.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What is the beautiful truth, Jim?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is that I loved you so much that I was willing
to take the most desperate chances to see you.
Whatever may happen to me for what I have done
will be but a small payment exacted from me in
return for the pleasure I have had.”</p>

<p class='c005'>With the adorable impudence of the Frenchwoman,
Miss Juan straightened back in the buggy
and looked at him with eyes that sparkled.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I have a beautiful truth to say, also,” she asserted.
“It is, that I love you, and if you ever get
out of your troubles alive I will marry you; and
if you get killed for what you have done, I will
mourn for you forever and forever.”</p>

<p class='c005'>She reached out and drew his head to her and
kissed him.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Go!” she said, as she pointed toward the Little
Moccasin Swamp, “and remember that my love
goes with you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>He did not hesitate a moment, but turned and
left her, pausing only to wave back at her as he
passed out of sight around the nearest corner.
The girl turned her buggy and started slowly back
toward her home, her heart heavy and her lovely
face picturing her wretchedness.</p>

<p class='c005'>To all of this, Little Bit had been an interested
<a id='Page_331'></a>witness. It was a free show, no charge for admission;
the first time in his life he had seen a love
scene between two white folks.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was evidently funny to him, for he sat there
laughing aloud, and his laugh bore a strong resemblance
to the cackling of a hen.</p>
<h3 class='c010'>VIII<br /> <br />GOING UP!</h3>

<p class='c011'>On the Little Moccasin prairie the excitement
and enjoyment of the negroes were at their
greatest height.</p>

<p class='c005'>The feeling of awe toward the airplane had
passed away. One by one they had climbed up
into the seat. After a while they seated Skeeter
Butts and Vinegar Atts in the machine, and every
man that had paid his dollar and wore his feather
in his cap took his turn at helping to push the airplane
over the ground. It was followed by all the
other negroes who shouted and whooped as it
bumped along over the prairie like some awkward,
stiff-legged, ridiculous bird which spurned the
earth and felt like it was a disgrace to be upon the
ground.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the midst of this excitement, with its noise of
laughter and the shouting, James Gannaway appeared
at the edge of the swamp and looked out
over the field with a real fear that he had never
<a id='Page_332'></a>felt, even in the most dangerous situations in the
air.</p>

<p class='c005'>What he saw filled his heart with joy. No more
fear that scouting planes had found the lost machine.
All that the feathers in the hats of the
negroes meant was that the blacks of Tickfall
had found the hidden airplane. He waited until
they had pushed the machine near to where he
stood concealed in the dense foliage of the swamp.
At that moment Vinegar Atts and Skeeter stood
up from their seats in the machine and began to
sing. It was one of the best-loved songs among
the negroes, and that great crowd sent it echoing
through the majestic forest with their mighty
organ tones until James Gannaway wondered
that the human voice could express such music.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“O come, angel band!</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Come, an’ aroun’ me stand!</div>
      <div class='line in1'>O bear me away on yo’ snowy wings</div>
      <div class='line in2'>To my immortal home;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>O bear me away on yo’ snowy wings</div>
      <div class='line in2'>To my immortal home.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>At the conclusion of the song, for some reason,
both Vinegar and Skeeter climbed out of the machine.
Then Gannaway stepped forth, waved a
dispersing hand, and exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c005'>“You niggers, get to hell away from here!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Nothing could have surprised the negroes more
than the appearance of this white man. Up to
<a id='Page_333'></a>that very moment they had never questioned
that the machine belonged to the negro, Red Cutt.
When they heard that voice of command and
turned their startled eyes to Gannaway, they
pushed backward in their fright and scattered
across the prairie like so many chickens.</p>

<p class='c005'>Gannaway sprang lightly into the machine and
started the engine. Three times in rapid succession
the engine back-fired, and the sound was
so similar to the explosion of a big army pistol that
the negroes believed the white man was shooting
at them. Then came the steady exhaust of the
engine, cracking like a rapid-fire machine-gun, and
every negro fell flat on his face to dodge the bullets
he thought were flying all around him.</p>

<p class='c005'>The machine went hopping awkwardly across
the long level stretch of ground, and the negroes
raised their heads like so many black lizards,
watching to see if the white man was shooting
toward them.</p>

<p class='c005'>A moment later five hundred negroes gave utterance
to an astounded “Ah!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Of that great crowd, Vinegar Atts and Red Cutt
had seen the airplane land; if Skeeter Butts was
not lying, he was the third of the crowd who had
seen an airplane in the air. Not one of the others
had ever witnessed such a flight, and this universal
exclamation emerged from their throats when
they saw the machine rise from the ground like a
wild goose and go sailing over the tops of the trees.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_334'></a>Five hundred negroes lying flat upon the
ground, with their noses almost touching the dirt,
put their hands on the feathers in their hats, to be
sure that their insignia of office had not departed
with the machine, and repeated their exclamation:
“Ah!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Suddenly the entire forest seemed to become
vocal and scream in fright. Thousands of birds
rose from the trees and circled round and round in
the air as if they were intoxicated. The smaller
birds flew from tree to tree, moving in a straight
line, all going in the same direction, as they do
when fleeing before a cyclone. The pigeons and
hawks shot straight up in the air and then tumbled
over and over as they came down, as if both wings
were broken. The great eagles rose like the fighting
creatures they are and threshed madly about
high up in the heavens, sending their ugly snarl-like
cries down to the earth, while from countless
pools in the swamp every sort of water fowl rose
with hoarse croaking voices and added to the aerial
tumult.</p>

<p class='c005'>To the negroes it seemed that the very skies
were dropping down upon them every feathered
creature God had ever made. They saw fowls of
the air that they did not know existed under the
heavens, and they heard bird-voices expressing
fright which possibly had never been heard by
human beings before.</p>

<p class='c005'>Somewhere outside of their range of vision the
<a id='Page_335'></a>airplane was still moving, for they could hear the
exhaust like a steady purr in the distance. Everywhere
that the machine went it caused the same
excitement among the birds, so that a great multitude
of these winged creatures were in terrified
flight.</p>

<p class='c005'>The terror laid hold upon the animals in the
swamp, for there suddenly rose in a mighty chorus
the scream of the panther and the wailing bark of
the wolf and the angry, frightened roar of the bear.
All the animals in the vicinity of the Little Moccasin
prairie very naturally ran toward that open
space; if rapid flight was necessary, any land
animal could travel faster where there were no
vines or stumps or trees or marshy places to hinder
flight.</p>

<p class='c005'>A drove of wild hogs, numbering several hundred,
traveling with the speed and noise of an express
train, and, like the exhaust of an automobile,
uttering at every jump their frightened exclamation:
“Whoof, whoof, whoof!” swept across that
prairie, and every negro flattened himself upon
the ground where he was lying and bawled aloud
his supplication to the Almighty: “Dat He
wouldn’t let no wild hawg step on him!” The
drove of hogs passed without damage.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then three young deer came galloping across
the field, leaping over those prostrated bodies and
dancing among the men, women, and children
like so many pet rabbits. Behind them two
<a id='Page_336'></a>panthers slung across the open space, spitting
venomously at something they thought they had
left in the woods.</p>

<p class='c005'>After that something arrived upon the scene
which brought every negro to his feet. Four black
bears came out of the woods and lumbered over
and joined the terrified negroes. The black bear
of Louisiana is small and harmless. But to a
negro he always looks extremely large and very
ferocious. The other wild animals that had
crossed the prairie seemed to have a destination,
and they went on across.</p>

<p class='c005'>When the black bears came they seemed to have
arrived at the place they were going and appeared
to be delighted at finding five or six hundred black
folks at the same place to receive them and protect
them. But the negroes sprang upon their
feet with five or six hundred assorted yells of
terror, and were getting ready to scatter out into
the woods when a sound above their heads caused
them to look up, and lo! the airplane had returned
and was now three thousand feet above them.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was the gloriously beautiful hour of sunset.
The sky was clear and the air was still. In a little
while the moon, which was even then visible in the
sky, would shine in full effulgence, and would
make an ideal night for the return of the airplane
to the aviation field.</p>

<p class='c005'>James Gannaway was feeling fine, and he
showed it by giving the negroes an exhibition of
<a id='Page_337'></a>stunt-flying. If he had known that the negroes
did not appreciate this exhibition for what it was
worth, he doubtless would have done the kindly
thing and gone on his way. But when the negroes
looked up in the air and saw the machine not much
larger in their sight than a toy, they forgot all
about the frolicking bears and were petrified by
terror at the vision above them.</p>

<p class='c005'>The machine turned upside down, then righted
itself, then began to ascend in long, spiral glides;
then turned upside down, and the aviator flew
in that position for some moments. Again the
machine righted itself and began to mount upward
until it was hardly more than a tiny speck
in the sky. Hovering directly above them it
dived and seemed to drop with the rapidity of a
falling star.</p>

<p class='c005'>Every negro nerved himself to see the machine
crash down upon the ground, when suddenly it
turned and once more began its beautiful flight,
up above the birds that screamed and circled and
tumbled in the air like circus performers.</p>

<p class='c005'>Vinegar Atts dropped upon his knees and lifted
up two black hands in the direction of the ascending
machine which now looked not much larger
than a wasp and bawled aloud:</p>

<p class='c005'>“O Lawd, ef you got any pity on dis pore nigger,
jes’ keep dat machine a gwine up!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Keep her gwine up, Lawd!” five hundred
voices wailed in a mighty chorus of endorsement.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_338'></a>“O Lawd, Thou hast told us dat de early bird
ketches de worm. Us is pore worms of de dust!
Perteck us from dat cherubim of de sky wid de
hands of a man under its wings!” Vinegar
whooped.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Perteck us, Lawd; hab mussy on us wormes!”
answered the frightened negroes in a mighty
chorus.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Keep dese here ole hawgs an’ bears an’ deerses
offen us, too, good Lawd!” Vinegar wailed. “We
don’t wanter ax too much of you-alls, but dese
here is perilous times fer pore he’pless niggers!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Us pore niggers!” the chorus howled. “O
Gawd, de birds of de air an’ de beasts of de field
is sot ag’in’ us, an’ ef you don’t he’p us, we is
blowed up blacks!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dar won’t be nothin’ left of us but remainders!”
Vinegar amended. “Some of us ain’t
never axed you fer nothin’ befo’, an’ we ain’t never
aimin’ to pester you agin. But we needs you
now, Lawd—dis here is a groun’-hawg case!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“A groun’-hawg—case!” the negroes wailed.</p>

<p class='c005'>“O Lawd, she’s a gittin’ littler an’ littler!”
Vinegar whooped. “She’s gwine up—gwine up—gwine
up! Don’t go back on us now an’ let her
drap down no more! Keep her gwine up!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Keep her gwine up!” the mob pleaded.</p>

<p class='c005'>The animal noises in the swamp had ceased.
The wild flight of the birds had taken them somewhere
else. The airplane was a tiny speck in the
<a id='Page_339'></a>sunset sky. But the mighty emotional crisis
through which the negroes had passed left them
raving in a delirium and acting like maniacs.</p>

<p class='c005'>Vinegar Atts was temporarily insane. The
other negroes were as crazy as bats. So, as they
knelt upon the grass of the prairie, they began a
mighty antiphony of Biblical quotations, Vinegar
leading the vociferation with a voice which shall
never be excelled in volume until the angel of time
shall stand with one foot on the land and the
other on the sea and swear that time shall be
no longer.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I seed a mighty angel come down from heaven,
clothed wid a cloud, an’ a rainbow wus upon his
head—” Vinegar roared.</p>

<p class='c005'>“An his face wus as de sun an’ his foots wus
pillars of fire!” the crowd answered.</p>

<p class='c005'>“An’ he helt in his hand a little book—” Vinegar
screamed.</p>

<p class='c005'>“An he sot his right foot in de sea an’ his left
foot on de yearth!” the mob responded.</p>

<p class='c005'>“An’ cried wid a loud voice as when a lion
roars!” Vinegar vociferated.</p>

<p class='c005'>“An’ when he had cried seben thunders uttered
deir voices!” the people whooped.</p>

<p class='c005'>They seemed to think that all of this was efficacious
in expediting the ascent of the airplane, for
as long as they kept it up the machine kept climbing.</p>

<p class='c005'>In a moment it disappeared from their sight.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_340'></a>“She’s gone!” they howled in a mighty chorus
of relief. “Bless Gawd, she’s done went up outen
our sight ferever!”</p>
<h3 class='c010'>IX<br /> <br />A BAG OF COTTON</h3>

<p class='c011'>The negroes drew the first easy breath they had
taken for several minutes.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Praise de Lawd!” Vinegar laughed. “I’s glad
I kept my good senses and didn’t git skeart!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Skeart!” Hitch Diamond mocked derisively.
“You wus so skeart you wus squealin’ like a burnt
pig!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I warn’t really a coward,” Vinegar said defensively.
“But I wus sort of discreet. An’ I wusn’t
by myself in dat—dis whole mob of niggers wus
movin’ from side to side in dis here prairie like
butter-beans b’ilin’ in a kittle.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Shore dey wus,” Hitch Diamond answered.
“Dey wus skeart an’ I wus skeart an’ eve’ybody
wus skeart—escusin’ you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dat ole airship is jes’ like a ole dog widout
no teeth—it makes a lot of noise, but ’tain’t no
harm,” Vinegar said complacently.</p>

<p class='c005'>Suddenly, from the direction of the setting sun, a
long, slanting shadow crossed the prairie like a black
knife cutting through their composure and leaving
them wide open to the terror which approached.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_341'></a>The airplane was advancing upon them, apparently
just skirting the tops of the trees, and the
noise of the exhaust of the engine was deafening,
terrifying, nerve-racking, a sound which reminded
these country negroes of nothing so much as a
great forest fire in a cane-brake where the popping
of the cane is like the musketry of battle. They
did not know whether to run or lie down or stand
still, but finally their action was universal and
automatic—they tumbled over on the ground like
a lot of dead geraniums in a broken pot. All of
this was an experience so entirely new to them
that there was no precedent; they had never been
along that path before. That great motor sounded
to them like disease and death, and it made enough
noise to make a snail jump through a barrel-hoop.</p>

<p class='c005'>But there is one thing every negro can do. His
fright is like kerosene poured on hot coals: it goes
up in vapor and goes off with a bang. When those
explosive sounds began to prod the negroes like
hat-pins running into their ears, they began to
howl and pray, and from five or six hundred throats
there arose an assorted series of yells—they sang
a long scale of variegated vociferations of fright—and
they uttered implorations and prayers, and
made promises to the God of heaven in return for
his protection, promises which they could not
have remembered in sober moments, much less
performed.</p>

<p class='c005'>As the machine came nearer to them and looked
<a id='Page_342'></a>like it was coming down to the ground to mow
them down with its wide-spreading wings, five
hundred men, women, and children flattened themselves
upon the ground, uttered a farewell gasp
like a fish dying in the bottom of a boat and prayed
that God would remove all rotundity and make
them as flat as a withered leaf to meet this emergency
that was upon them.</p>

<p class='c005'>When about one hundred feet above the ground
the aviator tossed out of the machine Hitch
Diamond’s bag of cotton waste. Had he known
the contents of that bag he would have tossed it
out a long time before. During all his stunts in
the air he had held this sack of worthless cotton
waste, and out of the kindness of a heart that was
full of love for a woman he had returned it to the
rightful owners.</p>

<p class='c005'>The bag landed on the shoulders of Vinegar
Atts. Vinegar merely spread out like a busted
bag of oats and sang an up-and-down tune of assorted
prayers like the howling of a hound dog.
After a long time, when the exhaust of the engine
sounded far away, he slowly rose up like a mouse
in a trap, scared and begging on its hind legs.</p>

<p class='c005'>“My Gawd!” he whooped. “I had a powerful
good chance fer heaven dat time. I’m got more
lives dan a litter of kittens!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then, seeing the bag of cotton waste on the
ground, for some reason he got the notion that
Hitch Diamond had hit him on the back with that
<a id='Page_343'></a>bag. He picked it up and struck Hitch over the
head with it.</p>

<p class='c005'>Hitch cautiously raised his head and elevated
his face toward the sky, his nose wrinkled up like
the front of a washboard. The airplane was far
away. He slowly turned his head and saw Vinegar
standing beside him with a bag of cotton waste
in his hand. His eyes stuck out like the buttons
on an overcoat, and he rose from the ground and
started for Vinegar with a bellow of rage which
had made him famous in the pugilistic ring in the
South.</p>

<p class='c005'>As if in answer to a signal every negro rose from
the ground and started a free-for-all fight, a rough-and-tumble
affair which is the delight of the darky
and generally does no great harm. Men and
women pushed and pounded at each other, and
grunted, and slapped faces, and wrestled, bouncing
chunks of wood off of each other’s heads and going
after each other’s skin like they were working by
the job and wanted to get it all off right away.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then a few not participating in the scrap glanced
up and pointed, exclaiming: “Look! Look dar!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Far up in the sunset sky, getting smaller and
smaller as it climbed, the beautiful airplane passed
into the purple and gold shadows of the closing
day and disappeared from their sight.</p>

<p class='c005'>There was an awed silence which was broken
after a moment by the snarling voice of Pap:
“Whar is dat Red Cutt gone at?”</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_344'></a>“He’s done gone!” dozens of voices answered.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Did he hab our money on him?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yep, he tuck it all!” Vinegar howled.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I said I’d make dat nigger fly!” Pap exclaimed.
“An’ now he has done flew!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“De way he flew is de only way he could fly,”
Skeeter Butts laughed. “I’m satisfied in my mind
dat nigger didn’t know any more about a airship
dan a dog knows about a white shirt. And now
he’s done run off wid my dollar.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I don’t keer,” Vinegar said. “I done got my
dollar’s wuth of fun outen dat machine, an’ I expeck
I’d better be gittin’ back to town. I’m got
to preach at de Shoofly church to-night.”</p>

<p class='c005'>In the fight which had occurred the bag of
cotton which the aviator had dropped from his
machine had been torn to pieces and the cotton
scattered all over the prairie. A number of negro
boys amused themselves by throwing the wads of
cotton at each other and at their elders. One
negro boy picked up a wad and hurled it at the
fat stomach of the Rev. Vinegar Atts.</p>

<p class='c005'>Vinegar doubled up with a yell of pain, and then
stooped and picked up something.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was a buckskin bag, which Vinegar had last
seen in the possession of Red Cutt.</p>

<p class='c005'>“My Gawd!” Hitch Diamond bellowed. “Ain’t
dat our bag of money?”</p>

<p class='c005'>With trembling fingers Vinegar untied the buckskin
bag and drew out a large number of soiled
<a id='Page_345'></a>bills. There was a shout of delight which James
Gannaway could have heard fifteen thousand feet
in the air.</p>

<p class='c005'>“When dat nigger, Red Cutt, climbed up into
dat machine, he hid dat money in my sack of cotton,”
Hitch howled, “an’ now we done get it all
back. Bless Gawd!”</p>

<p class='c005'>So it was a happy band which moved slowly
back to Tickfall. Vinegar Atts forgetting all
about his automobile walked back to town with
the others. He improvised a song on the way
which he taught his fellow pilgrims. The chorus,
repeated many times, was this:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“De airships fly up to de sky</div>
      <div class='line in2'>An’ circle all de stars around.</div>
      <div class='line in1'>While yuthers try to fly on high—</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Lawd, keep my foots on solid ground.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>When they had sung the chorus for about the
first time there was great excitement in Tickfall,
four miles away.</p>

<p class='c005'>The first army airplane ever seen in that neighborhood
flew over the town, and every man,
woman, and child was looking at it. The aviator
gave an exhibition of stunt flying. First, a series
of loops, then tail slides, then what he would have
called a “stall,” a maneuver in which the machine
was brought to a dead stop after reaching the apex
of an upward curve. Then he did side slides and
<a id='Page_346'></a>nose dives. It was wonderful to the people of
Tickfall to see the number of evolutions that pilot
put his machine through.</p>

<p class='c005'>There were all kinds of funny stunts, and that
machine cut all sorts of queer figures like a playful
kitten of the clouds.</p>

<p class='c005'>The people of Tickfall thought that he was
doing all of that for them—but they were greatly
mistaken.</p>

<p class='c005'>Everything James Gannaway did was a message
telling a certain girl that all was well with him,
that he would return to the aviation camp with his
own beautiful lie and her beautiful truth, and that
he anticipated no trouble before him. Most of
all, it was a message of passionate love to that same
girl, who now sat alone in her buggy on a sandy
road and looked up at the airplane with eyes that
filled with tears and glowed with love like stars.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
